	<h2><a href="#">moral reasoning&nbsp;<span><span>(</span>14 Sep 2006<span>)</span></span></a></h2>

	<p>I never really used to think so deeply about philosophy; the theoretical and the abstract in general have never really captivated me in any sort of way, mostly because there was usually no positive and/or beneficial change that came from purely argumentative and philosophical discussions &#8211; discussions which, subjective as they are by nature, almost always have gaping holes in their evidenciary support. To me, educated discussions about philosophy have always been a bunch of whining and complaining by an elite group of the overeducated who are well off enough or have a tremendous amount of disdain for work that they spend their time overthinking things.</p>

	<p>Concepts such as morality are distinctly human. Morality is important, but it is subjective and there are a lot of objective facts in this world that are undeniable and need to be taken care of. You can sit there looking comfortable in your New York penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side with your children who will have their every material whim catered to and only think fleetingly about those children on the other side of the globe who are in want of the most basic of human needs &#8211; and indeed, human rights. You can act as scholarly as you want, but the bottom line is, are you improving the situation? Are more children being fed?</p>
