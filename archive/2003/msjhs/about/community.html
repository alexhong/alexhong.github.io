	<h3>Student and Community Profile</h3>

	<p>Mission San Jose High School is located in a residential community in 
	the southeastern area of San Francisco Bay. It is one of five comprehensive 
	high schools in the <a href="#">Fremont Unified School District</a>, and serves 2035 
	students in grades nine through twelve. During the past six years, 
	enrollment at Mission has grown from 1950 to 2035, with a concomitant 
	increase in the ethnic diversity of the student body that is now 61%
	minority.</p>

	<p>The Mission San Jose community has high expectations. Mission and its 
	five feeder schools are widely perceived as excellent and enjoy strong 
	community support. Five of our schools have received state or national 
	recognition awards. Mission, itself, is a California Distinguished School 
	and a National Blue Ribbon School in both 1987 and 1996. Mission received 
	the 2000 Siemens High School Award for Advanced Placement. Two of Mission's 
	staff won national awards in 2000. We had a <a href="#">Disney's American Teacher Award</a> 
	winner and a Mathematical Association of America's Edyth May Sliffle Award 
	winner for Distinguished High School Mathematics Teaching. A community of 
	learners involved in collaborative improvement, the school is characterized 
	by organizational vitality, high student achievement, and the ability to 
	function in a manner clearly contributing to the attainment of school-wide 
	curricular and co-curricular goals.</p>

	<p>The focus of this school is the student, and student achievement is our 
	primary goal. Virtually every senior graduates. The attendance rate is 
	above 96 percent. The dropout rate is below 0.5 percent. 
	<acronym title="Scholastic Aptitude Test">SAT</acronym> scores are in 
	the top 5 percent of the nation. Sixty-five percent of students are on the 
	Honor Roll, and 95 percent of students go on to post-secondary schools. 
	Each year, Mission leads Alameda County in the number of National Merit 
	Scholar Finalists (29) and Commended Students (58). Mission's recent 
	<acronym title="Academic Performance Index">API</acronym> scores on the 
	California <acronym title="Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition">SAT-9
	</acronym> tests were 888 and 882, well above the level for high performing 
	schools. Mission had the highest ranking of 10 in both state and similar 
	school ranking.</p>

	<p>Mission's success is based upon the precept that <em>all students can and
	will learn</em>. The tone of this school expresses respect for the learner and 
	the process of learning. Projects that engender student participation are 
	prevalent throughout the school day. Mission students demonstrate their 
	mastery and in-depth learning with exhibits, projects, portfolios and 
	performances.</p>

	<p>In addition to a rigorous academic program for all students, we provide 
	a number of outstanding special programs. Our award winning Special 
	Education-Regular Education Collaborative Program has been selected as an 
	exemplar by the State of California. Our award-winning three-tiered 
	woodshop program is particularly exceptional, with students and teacher 
	garnering the top county and state awards for the past eighteen consecutive 
	years. Our students work at hundreds of different locations throughout the 
	community under the auspices of our Work Experience and <a href="#">Regional Occupation 
	Programs</a>. We are copartners with parents and the community in the 
	innovative Ohlone Tech Prep program, which creates a seamless articulated 
	sequence of career pathways, grade ten to graduate school. We offer college 
	courses on site through Ohlone College to expand the curricular choices for 
	our students.</p>

	<p>A varied and extensive co-curricular program involves the entire student 
	body in a full spectrum of athletics as well as over 40 clubs and student 
	organizations. Students take an active role in the leadership of the 
	school, contributing to a program enriches the school and the community 
	with public performances in drama, music, photography, drawing, and 
	painting. Award winning student publications, a school newspaper, and 
	literary and multicultural magazines, reflect the excellence of the school. 
	A partnership with the Fremont Chinese School has translated to six levels 
	of Mandarin in the foreign language curriculum. A consortium of the local 
	<acronym title="Regional Occupational Program">ROP</acronym>, community 
	college and Cal State campus is providing Career Paths for 
	our students in computer studies, merchandise/marketing, accounting, and 
	business office administration, with engineering and technology, and 
	computer aided manufacturing (<acronym title="Computer Aided Design">CAD
	</acronym>/<acronym title="Computer Aided Manufacturing">CAM</acronym>).</p>

	<p>No profile of Mission High could be complete without discussion of the 
	extent to which parents are involved in and dedicated to their children's 
	education. During each school year, 550 Mission parents volunteer over 
	3,000 hours of direct support here at school. In the past one to two years, 
	Mission parents worked in the library, cleaned and upgraded the playing 
	fields, upgraded the campus through the purchase of picnic tables and the 
	construction of seating areas, and raised over $200,000 in support of 
	curricular and co-curricular programs. They actively worked to increase the 
	involvement of minority parents in the <acronym title="Parent Faculty Association">
	PFA</acronym> and of families joining the 
	<acronym title="Parent Faculty Association">PFA</acronym> in general. Ninety 
	percent attended <acronym title="Back To School Night">BTSN</acronym> and 
	over 60% came to Advisement Conferences. Parents provide the senior class 
	with a full scale <a href="#">GRAD Nite</a> party. They designed, implemented and paid for 
	counselors to present "College Nights" for students and parents.
	</p>

	<p>Parents recognize the staff with special events throughout the year, 
	proctor competency, advanced placement, and Golden State Exams, help with 
	Hearing Tests, student orientation, and pre-registration, write and publish 
	the school newsletter on alternate months, and assemble and mail all the 
	school newsletters. Mission San Jose High School is a Digital High School. 
	We are in the first year of implementation and have formed a concrete 
	vision of where we want to be in terms of technology-based instruction. 
	Mission parents are active in the school's <a href="#">Technology Committee</a> and are 
	committed to implementing it. Many of them contributed their expertise to 
	our 16 Net Day activities and have worked with staff and students to 
	network the entire school.</p>

	<p>Mission San Jose High School and the community that it serves are 
	dedicated to building an ever-improving community of learning. During the 
	past five years, high-test scores and other objective indicators of student 
	success notwithstanding, we have initiated changes to align our school with 
	the California State Standards and to provide programs and structures to 
	better serve our students. To that end we joined the California League of 
	High Schools. These efforts to continually improve the school have lead to 
	interdisciplinary units, Tech Prep Career Pathways, and local partnerships 
	for our students. Mission San Jose is school intent on providing the best 
	for its students.</p>
