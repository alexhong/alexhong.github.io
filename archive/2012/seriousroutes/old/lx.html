<p>Since there has been so much curiosity and confusion surrounding the circumstances of my deletion and since I have no reservations about sharing any of it, I thought I would take a moment to spell out my multiple Terms of Service violations in detail:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Taking advantage of an undocumented API function to track in-game items and view the contents of containers in which these items were located. This was used to track down feeders/collectors that were removed from home streets by other players (back when this was still possible), as well as to look inside the bags of staff members out of curiosity. It was discovered by staff when they decided to read our in-game IMs; we know this because our web analytics showed URLs that were sent only through IM being accessed from Tiny Speck servers and shared in the staff IRC channel.</p></li>

<li><p>Taking advantage of a &#8220;bug&#8221; that allowed a Special Item That Only Beta Testers Get to drop multiple Musicblock GNGs, which were sold for in-game currency. I played a small role in the discovery of this loophole, and at its peak, at least a dozen other players were aware of it, many of whom took advantage of it in the same manner. To my knowledge, only one other player was punished (due to an abuse report). No one was suspended or banned.</p></li>

<li><p>Using a keyboard macro to automatically pick up keys as they spawned, which were distributed to players who needed them. This was the final violation for which I was presumably banned, although no official explanation was given beyond &#8220;repeat TOS violations.&#8221;</p></li>

</ul>

<p>I apologize to anyone my actions may have hurt; it was never my intention. All I can say is that for as many times as I&#8217;ve violated the ToS, I&#8217;ve never once violated the Golden Rule: I have done nothing I would object to in others (and in fact did not object on similar occasions), but I realize every person&#8217;s idea of ethical behavior differs.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I feel I have contributed enough to the community to more than offset whatever damage I may have done. Glitch is the only MMO I&#8217;ve played for any length of time, in no small part because of the people I&#8217;ve met along the way. Thank you all for making my time here such a pleasure.</p>
