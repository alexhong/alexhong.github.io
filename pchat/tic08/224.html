	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:00] kass:</b> On the other hand, Andy's friend should really have been more straightforward about who he was when the rest of us were seriously asking him.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:03] aqhong:</b> For the record, she was also IMing me about it, so I took her seriously.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:09:12] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥:O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:12] Janvi:</b> yeah, same...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:19] kass:</b> Okay. I wasn't getting anything, obviously.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:09:24] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥she turned to alex and janvi for protection!</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:26] kass:</b> I wasn't paying full attention either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:09:58] kass:</b> Right, but he wasn't taking you seriously, I guess. This is a problem, since I can't always be here to lay down the law. Not that it made a difference... he didn't pay attention to me either at the beginning.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:10:37] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥andy, how good of friends are you with him?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:10:41] kass:</b> In that case, Alex, I guess you really acted the only way you could.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:10:43] ND44:</b> best friends O.o</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:11:04] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥do you go to the same school?</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:11:46] kass:</b> So I think things just went wrong when he wasn't being upfront about who he was.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:11:48] ND44:</b> iono, im used to that kind of random stuff. sorry xP</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:12:33] kass:</b> And having someone totally unfamiliar pop into an environment where normally everyone has already met face to face -- or is expected to be someone withint a particular community -- is probably a little odd.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:12:37] ND44:</b> like, i said he was my friend. but iono ify ou guys read it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:13:03] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥well, he said you guys didnt know each other for real..</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:13] Janvi:</b> eh.. I think we'd be used to it too if we had known beforehand</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:18] kass:</b> Again, I personally don't have a problem with friends of anyone's coming here and hanging out, as long as they recognize that this is supposed to be an educational facility first.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:22] aqhong:</b> I was gonna say stuff in here, but I figured Kass would say everything I wanted to say anyway, so I just went to watch the trailer :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:27] kass:</b> And obviously, they can't upset the regulars.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:15:38] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥lol. taking the backseat </li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:41] kass:</b> Sorry. Didn't mean to usurp your soapbox.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:46] Max:</b> Koki's friends have been around a few times as a comparison</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:15:56] Janvi:</b> But they've never been that social hahaha</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:16:00] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:05] ND44:</b> mine are different xP</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:09] aqhong:</b> And Koki at least let us know beforehand...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:19] kass:</b> Right... that's kind of a big thing too.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:33] kass:</b> If you're going to invite someone, let us know in advance, so that we don't think it's some random creep.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:45] kass:</b> Because that shit does happen. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:50] ND44:</b> i blame him for saying that he didn't know me &gt;:[</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:16:58] kass:</b> Yes, that was very stupid of him.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:17:14] ND44:</b> i'll remember next time xD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:17:15] kass:</b> Technically this is an IRL community, so we expect people to be honest about who they are.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:17:28] kass:</b> Not like WoW or whatever where people can lie about anything.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:17:30] kass:</b> And no one gives.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:17:37] ND44:</b> lawl.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:18:01] kass:</b> Actually... what it really is is that... BECAUSE this is an IRL community, people who are hiding their identity are technically threats to our safety, cause we're sharing IRL info all the time.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:18:06] kass:</b> So yeah... has to go both ways.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:18:18] kass:</b> Either everyone lies or no one does. XP</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:18:19] ND44:</b> i guess, that makes sense xP</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:19:26] kass:</b> All righty. No longlasting harm done. Though if someone would give the two cent summary to Tif when they see her, maybe that'd be good.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:19:42] aqhong:</b> I don't think she could sit still for even a two-cent summary :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:19:46] kass:</b> For some reason, they think they can be separated by calling one Tiff and the other Tif.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D79">[00:19:55] foxyfigureskater:</b> ♥ xD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#5D94A2">[00:19:56] ND44:</b> say what...</li>
