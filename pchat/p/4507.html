	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:16:11] lloyd:</b> ...the Gertner NY Times article and the Seattle Times report.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:16:22] lloyd:</b> Er, op-ed.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:17:20] lloyd:</b> I'm completely schizophrenic about all this, btw... on one hand, I'm happy to be living on this island, and therefore buffered immediately from any water wars. OTOH, we're almost 100% dependent on imported energy.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:17:42] lloyd:</b> If energy supplies dwindle or vanish, we'd be very quickly back to the basics.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:18:59] lloyd:</b> Exactly. If I were dictator of a Hawaii republic, I would immediately buy up as much solar tech as we have money...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:19:14] lloyd:</b> ...and enact draconian laws to compel the public to use solar energy.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:19:47] lloyd:</b> Then closely after that, do wind and sea-current farming.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:21:07] lloyd:</b> As for the People's Republic of California, you must immediately erect barriers and set your armies on the EAST side of the Sierras, to ensure that you retain all that snowmelt. ;p</li>

	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:23:11] Forward Biased:</b> doesn't have to be that draconian, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:23:23] Forward Biased:</b> incentives do work, right? ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:23:30] lloyd:</b> One has to desperately hope so.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:23:48] lloyd:</b> But I think water (like climate) is one of those on-off state switches. There's no in-between.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:23:48] Forward Biased:</b> at least, in the case of CFL light bulbs, they're working, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:24:33] lloyd:</b> Yeah, CFL light bulbs are an effective solution... but it has to be scaled up, to include all sorts of other technologies and processes. That's the tricky part.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:24:39] Forward Biased:</b> yeah, water is somewhat different... with energy, there are quite a few sources to gather it from and quite a few ways to make devices more efficient</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:25:19] Forward Biased:</b> you mean making people willing to replace larger appliances?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:25:26] lloyd:</b> Yup.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:26:15] lloyd:</b> These days, there's way too much dirty water (in the form of floods) in some parts of the world, and not enough clean water in other parts. Torrential storms don't really help; in fact, they worsen the equation by eroding groundcover (hence forests).</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:26:16] Forward Biased:</b> the thing about CFLs is that PG&amp;E is offering a huge discount on them. They really have to offer the same kind of deal on large appliances too.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:27:16] lloyd:</b> I don't remember if I mentioned this to you a couple of years ago, Quad...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:28:32] lloyd:</b> ...but around that time, maybe 2004 or thereabouts, my brother told me that if I wanted to recommend an investment strategy, that I actually look into water companies, as it was a more certain play than metals. ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:29:00] lloyd:</b> Water bottlers large and small are raking in the bucks these days.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:29:48] Forward Biased:</b> like Alhambra and Coca-Cola?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:29:52] lloyd:</b> I wonder where Coca Cola gets its water for Dasani. Surely not Lake Lanier. lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:31:09] Forward Biased:</b> if there's any catastrophic drought though, water bottlers would be in trouble too...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:31:22] Forward Biased:</b> unless they control their sources of water</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:31:44] lloyd:</b> Very true. And that's exactly where the locus of conflict will be.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:32:08] lloyd:</b> Here on Maui, we know exactly how that will be, by the way.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:32:25] lloyd:</b> The county doesn't control the water... it's the pineapple and sugarcane companies that do.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:32:48] lloyd:</b> But in a pinch, there's absolutely nothing these companies can do to sequester &quot;their&quot; water.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:33:11] lloyd:</b> Because even their hired security goons (if any) will be locals with families needing water. lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:33:30] lloyd:</b> All Baldwin &amp; C&amp;H can do is import armies. ;p And that's not going to be possible.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:33:36] Forward Biased:</b> the local government can use eminent domain to take the water from the companies, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:33:57] lloyd:</b> Oh yes. But in a chaotic situation, eminent domain is trumped by imminent need. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:34:24] Forward Biased:</b> I mean, the government would seize the water for its citizens...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:34:56] lloyd:</b> In principle, and in a civilized situation, yes... that's what would happen.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:35:43] lloyd:</b> As it is, the vast bulk of water on this island goes to (1) sugarcane fields, (2) golf courses (3) resorts. </li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:35:52] lloyd:</b> Domestic use is far down on the scale of usage.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:36:12] lloyd:</b> So, there's plenty of water. It just has to allocated 'correctly.'</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:37:46] lloyd:</b> As you might infer, I (and my bro) have been thinking a heck of a lot about the &quot;What then?&quot; question that Tom Engelhardt poses.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:37:57] lloyd:</b> But only on our microcosmic level.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:38:26] lloyd:</b> I don't even want to imagine what it might be like on a larger scale. He's right. People really would prefer not to look/know.</li>
	<li class="status">[12:39:18] MyNamelsFrank returned.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:40:13] lloyd:</b> My brother and I have thought of enough detail to ask the technical questions: so, which canal/ditch transfers the East Maui water to which sugarcane fields? And: to what extent is the West Maui aquifer still able to leach water onto taro fields (that is, without use of pumps).</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:41:32] lloyd:</b> We have a very good idea of the answers to these questions (we've done our forays and expeditions ::chuckle::)... and whoever has the answers to these simple water questions, will have the influence. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[12:43:02] Forward Biased:</b> only if people trust you ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:43:11] lloyd:</b> Note, &quot;influence.&quot; Not &quot;power.&quot; We prefer to be Machiavelli... not the kings themselves. ;-)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[12:45:42] lloyd:</b> It's the same as people trusting that 1 + 1 actually equals 2. When they see that it's a plain fact that Pukalani Ditch 2A is the main conduit to the Hamakua aquifer (and they can certainly verify that for themselves), then they'll have faith in our findings. :-)</li>
