	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:28:23] Kass:</b> I mean, right now, raiding is boring because all you get are resources which you spend to level up your town, which just goes to making more villages...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:28:33] Forward Biased:</b> its only boosts are attack (to self or army), defense (ditto), regen...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:28:48] Kass:</b> Eh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:01] Kass:</b> That's a little better than straight out army-to-army.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:11] Kass:</b> Not really any more tangible, though.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:29:14] Forward Biased:</b> it's basically army-to-army though</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:34] Kass:</b> Anyway. If anyone has poor reasons for playing Travian, it's me, as we all know now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:29:41] Forward Biased:</b> the only difference is that sometimes you'll run into a +20% defense army because of their hero</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:30:07] lloyd:</b> Aren't you missing a crucial element of raiding, Kass? I do a lot of it to get resources to build army with. It's not just to level up buildings, at least for me.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:56] Kass:</b> The whole point of this game is to get resources.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:27] Kass:</b> In the end, I look at it this way... I wouldn't like it if someone attacked me repeatedly, trying to get resources.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:43] Kass:</b> Therefore, being the carebear that I am, I don't attack others unless they attack me first.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:33:30] Kass:</b> I used to scout for abandoned villages, but that quickly becomes a useless endeavor... takes too much effort to find one and then you'll quickly start to empty it out much faster than it'll refill.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:33:44] Kass:</b> Travian is definitely not for carebear players like me. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:33:53] Forward Biased:</b> agreed ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:34:00] lloyd:</b> Well, it's been fascinating for me to see how people behave in the game. Others are not nearly as carebearish. ;-)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:02] Kass:</b> Because you really do have to forget about the fact that there are other humans playing and just be greedy.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:32] Kass:</b> So no, I'm not missing anything about raiding.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:40] Kass:</b> In fact, you could say I'm a little too omniscient about raiding.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:35:01] lloyd:</b> Oh, I certainly had that experience quite vividly. About being greedy. But then, I believe I transformed it into something else other than just naked greed. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:35:18] Kass:</b> And what might that be?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:35:30] lloyd:</b> The two situations early on, with Neil and Jacedog...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:36:34] lloyd:</b> ...where Neil became an ally/friend. And Jacedog, I convinced to move his village so I could take the space... while helping him start afresh elsewhere. In either case, I could have easily just continued being a greedy raider. But chose not to, seeing obviously that, a you say, they were &quot;other humans playing.&quot;</li>
