	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[17:51:44] Spark:</b> so most of the back and forth could happen between you two</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:52:16] Kass:</b> I honestly don't think it's constructive to have only two of us talking, but whatever.</li>
	<li><b>[17:52:23] aqhong:</b> &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[17:52:38] aqhong:</b> Is it more or less constructive than no one talking?</li>

	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[17:53:01] Spark:</b> there are issues to discuss!</li>
	<li><b>[17:53:11] aqhong:</b> I'm ready to discuss them!</li>
	<li><b>[17:53:16] aqhong:</b> THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:53:26] Kass:</b> If the programmer doesn't give input and doesn't understand what we're talking about after we're done talking about it, then it's not any more constructive at all. ;P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:53:29] Kass:</b> But whatever.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:53:44] Kass:</b> Your forum example doesn't seem to me to be any different from a weblog commenting thread.</li>
	<li><b>[17:54:05] aqhong:</b> Yeah, that's true.</li>
	<li><b>[17:54:14] aqhong:</b> I guess I'd like forums to look like weblog comments.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:54:15] Kass:</b> And from the &quot;big picture&quot; standpoint, which is about all I'm good for these days, this is one of the things you have to decide on what's important audience wise...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:54:40] Kass:</b> i.e. if you want there to be an obvious difference between a weblog thread and a forum thread, it better look different.</li>
	<li><b>[17:54:43] aqhong:</b> IoCM already renders them the same way. Except it decided to use forum layout fr both of them.</li>
	<li><b>[17:54:53] aqhong:</b> Should there be an obvious difference?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:55:01] Kass:</b> Well that's something we have to decide on. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[17:55:06] Spark:</b> it's a good question</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[17:55:17] Spark:</b> without an obvious answer imo</li>
	<li><b>[17:55:28] aqhong:</b> I'm leaning towards no at the moment.</li>
	<li><b>[17:55:32] aqhong:</b> Definitely open to debate, though.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:55:38] Kass:</b> Why are you leaning towards no?</li>
	<li><b>[17:56:21] aqhong:</b> Why should there be an obvious difference? They're both conversation threads... one of them stems off a weblog post, one off a forum post.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:57:44] Kass:</b> In that case, why differentiate between forums and weblogs ever at all?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:57:59] Kass:</b> A weblog is just a forum in which only one person has permission to post new threads.</li>
	<li><b>[17:58:08] aqhong:</b> I guess so.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:58:51] Kass:</b> That's totally acceptable to you and you think we should handle it that way?</li>
	<li><b>[17:59:10] aqhong:</b> I never said that... I'm just saying your conclusion seems logical.</li>
	<li><b>[17:59:21] aqhong:</b> Are you just trying to antagonize me? lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:59:33] Kass:</b> Of course not. :P</li>
	<li><b>[17:59:41] aqhong:</b> Well, how do you feel about it?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:00:10] Kass:</b> I dunno. From a programming standpoint, that's pretty much what the difference is, we don't have to beat around the bush.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:00:31] Kass:</b> But the fact is that there are forums and there are weblogs and there have historically been clear visual differences between each.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:00:52] Kass:</b> Is this just because we're accustomed to doing it that way or is there a stronger reason for this?</li>
	<li><b>[18:01:15] aqhong:</b> I don't know.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:01:30] Kass:</b> Well me neither. :P</li>
	<li><b>[18:01:46] aqhong:</b> Great :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:01:49] Kass:</b> Just saying that I get the feeling there is more to this than my apparently logical conclusion from earlier.</li>
	<li><b>[18:01:57] aqhong:</b> There probably is.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:02:07] Kass:</b> We can just decide to screw that and go with making every conversation thread look the same.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:02:14] Kass:</b> If you guys like.</li>
	<li><b>[18:02:25] aqhong:</b> As long as we're writing from scratch, though, we may as well think about it instead of just doing it the way it's always been done. At least that's how I feel.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:02:47] Kass:</b> Of course, as long as there's good reason for doing it a new way.</li>
	<li><b>[18:03:26] aqhong:</b> It's more like... is there a good reason for doing it the old way?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:03:51] Spark:</b> comfort</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:03:58] Kass:</b> There are plenty of reasons to stick with convention. :P Audiences will know what to expect already, eases their transition into new software, etc.</li>
	<li><b>[18:03:58] aqhong:</b> True.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:03:59] Spark:</b> I don't know if that's a good reason</li>
	<li><b>[18:04:05] aqhong:</b> No, it's a valid one.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:04:07] Spark:</b> but it's nice to use something that you understand coming into</li>
	<li><b>[18:04:08] aqhong:</b> Familiarity.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:04:13] Spark:</b> exactly the word I was looking for</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:04:14] Kass:</b> How many people do not know how to use the &amp;%#$ing Append button in IoCM?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:04:18] Kass:</b> They're all like, where's my edit button!</li>
	<li><b>[18:04:27] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:04:34] Spark:</b> it doens't mean we shouldn't try to change things where change is good</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:04:40] Kass:</b> That's Kenton thinking he's breaking new ground and failing.</li>
	<li><b>[18:04:58] aqhong:</b> He's breaking new ground... and falling in it :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:05:37] Kass:</b> While we're at it, maybe we should just come up with ways in which weblog commenting and forum threads are different.</li>
	<li><b>[18:05:47] aqhong:</b> Yeah.</li>
	<li><b>[18:05:59] aqhong:</b> Specifically the commenting part, or also in general?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:06:05] Kass:</b> Just everything.</li>
	<li><b>[18:06:38] aqhong:</b> Okay. Weblogs have an assumed chronological order to the posts that doesn't change.</li>
	<li><b>[18:06:46] aqhong:</b> Posts don't get &quot;bumped&quot; in any way when people comment on them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:48] Kass:</b> Ah, that's interesting.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:08:47] Spark:</b> you don't generally have a listing of weblog posts in the way that you do for a forum</li>
	<li><b>[18:08:54] aqhong:</b> Right.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:09:14] Spark:</b> usually it's the most recent stuff that's the most interesting</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:09:24] Spark:</b> well, kind of true for a forum too</li>
	<li><b>[18:09:43] aqhong:</b> In terms of the actual thread view itself, though, I don't see why there needs to be differentiation in that. Quoting, replying, editing all seem like functions that would apply to both.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:09:46] Spark:</b> I think the major difference though is just that in a weblog, one person is the thread starter</li>
	<li><b>[18:09:50] aqhong:</b> Are there things that would only apply to one or the other?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:11:06] Kass:</b> Well, even worse, quoting and replying aren't actually features of forums... they're only traditional methods for shortcutting the &quot;add to thread&quot; process.</li>
	<li><b>[18:11:43] aqhong:</b> Yeah, I guess.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:12:35] Kass:</b> So you guys are still thinking about functionality... I'd like to think about expected usage.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:12:38] Spark:</b> I feel like everything other than what I just said it comfort factor</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[18:12:48] Spark:</b> and our decision is how much each of these things is important to us</li>
	<li><b>[18:12:53] aqhong:</b> What do you mean by expected usage?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:08] Kass:</b> For example... *because* a weblog is a &quot;forum where only one person starts threads&quot;... the quantity of threads is lower.</li>
	<li><b>[18:13:40] aqhong:</b> How does that affect the thread view?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:41] Kass:</b> aka ... forums will generally have a bigger audience and higher run of traffic.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:52] Kass:</b> It doesn't have to.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:57] Kass:</b> But I think it's important to keep in mind.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:14:47] Kass:</b> Also... forums are trawled by a bigger variety of people looking for things they're interested in, whereas it probably follows that people reading a blog will be interested in everything someone has to say in all their posts.</li>
