	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:37] Kass:</b> What about... in a weblog, when the original poster makes a comment, are they more important than everyone else who comments?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:58] Kass:</b> And in a forum, when the original poster responds in their thread... are they more important than everyone else who posts to it?</li>
	<li><b>[18:16:27] aqhong:</b> Good point.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:17:00] Kass:</b> It does seem like most of the differences can be handled in the way that the &quot;topics&quot; are displayed.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:17:31] Kass:</b> i.e. forums just have a list of the thread topics and you just browse that, versus a weblog which has a short synopsis of what the post is about and then a link to &quot;read more&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:18:10] Kass:</b> But I think there is a particular mindset that people get into when they are browsing what they know to be a forum and what they know to be a blog...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:18:23] Kass:</b> Where in a blog, the person who wrote the post has the most authority, so to speak.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:18:30] Kass:</b> And... oh, here's a power dynamic...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:18:47] Kass:</b> If they comment about something and the blog author doesn't like it... bam, delete.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:19:24] Kass:</b> So... I think this is part of why I'm hesitant to just combine the two things.</li>
	<li><b>[18:19:36] aqhong:</b> I'm not really suggesting that we combine anything...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:19:38] Kass:</b> Because there's definitely something subconscious to the whole internet discussion mentality.</li>
	<li><b>[18:19:52] aqhong:</b> As I mentioned before, IoCM already displays weblog comments and forum comments the exact same way.</li>
	<li><b>[18:19:57] aqhong:</b> Does anyone have a problem with that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:20:20] Kass:</b> That's a good question.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:20:28] Kass:</b> I actually think I don't care for it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:20:46] Kass:</b> It's not in any degree that I would fight it, but...</li>
	<li><b>[18:21:04] aqhong:</b> Do you have a specific design in mind for either of them, or do you just think they should different in some way?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:31] Kass:</b> I think my concern is that at any given point, you should be able to look at the thread you are posting in and know that you're looking at a forum thread or a weblog comment thread.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:42] Kass:</b> How you bring about that understanding ... I don't really care.</li>
	<li><b>[18:21:51] aqhong:</b> Okay.</li>
	<li class="status">[18:22:48] Spark went away: 6:22 PM (PDT)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:23:13] Kass:</b> There are probably some other concerns, too... whether you expect people to make long responses in comments or short ones in forums... vice versa. And then the layout you pick should reflect that. But that's unpredictable behavior, anyway.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:24:43] Kass:</b> Anyway... that was all I was concerned about. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[18:25:22] aqhong:</b> Well, I'm glad you brought it up. I wouldn't've thought of all those things myself.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:25:47] Kass:</b> Meh, it's all I'm good at. :P</li>
	<li><b>[18:26:02] aqhong:</b> What's all you're good at? Thinking? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:26:26] Kass:</b> I don't really know what that was. :P</li>
	<li><b>[18:26:38] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:27:31] Kass:</b> I think that... I seem to be good at consuming things and later looking back and understanding the various components while I was using it.</li>
	<li><b>[18:27:35] aqhong:</b> Anyway, what started all this is just me preferring the visual design of weblog comments over typical phpBB-style forum posts.</li>
	<li><b>[18:28:16] aqhong:</b> Well, that's a useful skill.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:28:39] Kass:</b> Probably. It's rather understated though. &gt;_&gt; Anyway. Yes, that's fine. I figured that's the case.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:28:48] Kass:</b> I do think it'd be nice to cut down on data bloat.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:29:39] Kass:</b> But we need to make sure that people get enough of their personalization desires (avatars, sigs, blah blah), whatever else we end up cutting.</li>
	<li><b>[18:29:56] aqhong:</b> Naturally.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:30:08] Kass:</b> It really seems to me that the key difference between blog and forum is like... my house vs town hall.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:30:20] Kass:</b> Or community center.</li>
	<li><b>[18:30:30] aqhong:</b> Actually, sigs kind of cut into the ideal of that type of weblog display in that it interrupts an otherwise continuous flow of conversation, haha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:00] Kass:</b> I'll agree with that, but it's another point to consider... are forums &quot;conversations&quot;?</li>
	<li><b>[18:31:00] aqhong:</b> Well, sigs aren't even allowed in weblog comments.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:04] Kass:</b> Forum threads, I mean.</li>
	<li><b>[18:31:15] aqhong:</b> Aren't they?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:33] Kass:</b> Hard to say. It really ends up depending on the community and what they use the forum for.</li>
	<li><b>[18:31:49] aqhong:</b> I guess. But whatever it is, I think the same can be said of weblog comments.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:32:07] Kass:</b> But no one ever implements weblog comment signatures.</li>
	<li><b>[18:32:07] aqhong:</b> It's not always conversation either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:32:17] Kass:</b> They do avatars sometimes.</li>
	<li><b>[18:32:17] aqhong:</b> Right.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:32:20] Kass:</b> Which is interesting.</li>
	<li><b>[18:32:28] aqhong:</b> ...what's the point of signatures, anyway?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:32:49] Kass:</b> Dunno. More personalized way of illustrating who you are? Got me.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:33:03] Kass:</b> Spark does use WoW forum signature in a very particular way.</li>
	<li><b>[18:33:04] aqhong:</b> Never been a fan of them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:33:12] Kass:</b> He has a link to an image that lists all his characters.</li>
	<li><b>[18:33:13] aqhong:</b> Unless there's an actual functional use.</li>
	<li><b>[18:33:17] aqhong:</b> Yeah, something like that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:33:18] Kass:</b> Since on WoW forums, you post by character.</li>
	<li><b>[18:33:24] aqhong:</b> otherwise, it's just more visual clutter to me.</li>
	<li><b>[18:33:32] aqhong:</b> Stuff like witty quotes, etc... meh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:34:02] Kass:</b> This is probably one of the things that is traditional that we might want to consider tossing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:34:03] Kass:</b> ::lol::</li>
	<li><b>[18:34:47] aqhong:</b> I agree.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:35:01] Kass:</b> If I had to guess... I would say that signatures are probably tideover from when message boards were first created and were emulating e-mails.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:35:12] Kass:</b> And e-mails emulated real mail, of course.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:35:23] Kass:</b> So the signature just kept propogating.</li>
	<li><b>[18:36:06] aqhong:</b> Yeah, that's what I figured. Kind of pointless, now, though, with the amount of information already attached to the post by default.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:36:38] Kass:</b> It's interesting why it finally stopped at weblog comments... but I guess it's because comments were originally meant to be quick, fast, and not thoughtful.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:38:12] Kass:</b> Anyway, I agree, we can probably dropkick that and most people won't care... and those who do, we don't want them posting anyway. D:</li>
	<li><b>[18:39:33] aqhong:</b> I think some forums allow you to have a like a &quot;title&quot; under your avatar. Allows for a little more personality, i guess, without being as visually obnoxious as a signature.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:39:47] Kass:</b> But who sets that?</li>
	<li><b>[18:40:19] aqhong:</b> Well, there are default ones that are based on member status or post count or something. but you can also just have them free-form and let the user pick.</li>
	<li><b>[18:40:31] aqhong:</b> orrrr have a reward system that allows them to pick after they get some number points :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:41:17] Kass:</b> ::twitch::</li>
	<li><b>[18:41:26] aqhong:</b> lol, not a fan of the point system?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:41:48] Kass:</b> I'm undecided.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:42:02] Kass:</b> The decay system, obviously, should have had a toggle at least.</li>
	<li><b>[18:42:12] aqhong:</b> No decay system please.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:42:34] Kass:</b> Points in general are a difficult matter altogether... they're an artificial method for creating community.</li>
	<li><b>[18:43:01] aqhong:</b> Yeah, I dunno how I feel about points either.</li>
	<li><b>[18:43:26] aqhong:</b> Anyway, points aside, I think that's a pretty good compromise if you wanted something to replace sigs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:44:04] Kass:</b> Well, now that I think about it, what sigs should be used for is to describe really fast &quot;who you are&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:44:10] Kass:</b> Without requiring someone to click on your profile link.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:44:53] Kass:</b> ... When I describe it like that, it doesn't really seem all that bad or terrible.</li>
	<li><b>[18:44:59] aqhong:</b> Example?</li>
	<li><b>[18:45:24] aqhong:</b> I don't think I've ever seen a sig that gave me any significant insight into who the poster was, lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:45:31] Kass:</b> I didn't say it was significant.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:45:44] Kass:</b> Just that that's how said person is choosing to describe themselves in x chars or less.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:45:52] Kass:</b> It's very context dependent, as well.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:46:27] Kass:</b> I dunno. Requires a lot of thought, this. D:</li>
	<li><b>[18:46:30] aqhong:</b> I think an avatar and a title, which is maybe a few words max, is enough.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:47:21] Kass:</b> Perhaps, yeah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:51:07] Kass:</b> Anyway... whatever we do, instead of points, it's probably better to just have a series of checkboxes.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:51:18] Kass:</b> Allow posters to have: avatars, titles, post colors.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:51:23] Kass:</b> To customize, rather.</li>
	<li><b>[18:54:12] aqhong:</b> Yeah, that's a given.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:06:13] Kass:</b> The fade is a little odd, but otherwise I like it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:06:38] Kass:</b> You do have to consider, though... the 9 hours ago, 8 hours ago...</li>
