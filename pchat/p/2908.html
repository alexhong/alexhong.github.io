	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:55:45] lloyd:</b> And he doesn't have the 'psychological grammar' yet, least of all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:56:41] lloyd:</b> He isn't maladjusted, by any stretch of the imagination. I know kids who are far worse off in that department, really, and they haven't been through a fraction of what he has gone through.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:57:10] lloyd:</b> It's just that sometimes he gets this look, and begs me to tell him again that I'll never leave him.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:58:49] lloyd:</b> I've stopped surfing, for one thing, because I've had near-drowning incidents there. lol</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:03:03] lloyd:</b> I'm almost certain, jinx-like as this might be to articulate... that if only I can get him through the shoals of the teenage years and on into young adulthood, he'll be fine.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:03:17] Vivian:</b> well yes</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:03:21] lloyd:</b> But again, things can be awfully arbitrary and unexpected.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:04:33] lloyd:</b> I have some valuable experience tucked under my belt... all those years of mentoring kids at ATDP since the late '80s... ::chuckle:: And there was a whole panoply of experience, both good and bad, that that entailed.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:04:47] Vivian:</b> hahaha i'll say</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:04:54] Vivian:</b> you have a lot of experience with kids</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:06:29] lloyd:</b> Did I ever tell you about one of them, one of the early ones... who succumbed to a life of white-collar crime for a while? Very early digital/internet fraud. ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:06:38] lloyd:</b> He got caught, spent a few years in the slammer.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:06:39] Vivian:</b> no i don't think so</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:07:20] Vivian:</b> do you still keep in touch with him?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:07:25] lloyd:</b> Ominously, he was the one whose early childhood experiences reminds me of Pono's. He was a child of the foster system.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:07:36] lloyd:</b> Yes. He's still on my buddy list, and we chat now and then.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:08:29] Vivian:</b> do you talk to him about pono?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:08:43] lloyd:</b> No. He wouldn't understand why, just yet.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:08:50] lloyd:</b> Oh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:08:54] lloyd:</b> I misread that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:09:02] lloyd:</b> Yes, I do as a matter of fact.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:09:47] Vivian:</b> i don't know it's so hard for me to imagine looking after someone else </li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:10:10] Vivian:</b> i have a hard time being responsible for myself still</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:10:20] lloyd:</b> He was always dirt poor. Partially raised by his grandma but didn't live with her as she was disabled. So he lived in foster homes. So by the time he got to college (and he was brilliant with computers), he thought he could take the easy way out, and made some ill-advised 'career moves,' under the sway of these really smart computer nerds with criminal tendencies. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:10:25] lloyd:</b> Russians. ::chuckles::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:10:37] Vivian:</b> lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:11:09] lloyd:</b> They were busted. The ringleader got 20. D, a mere 4, but got out after half on good behavior.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:11:42] lloyd:</b> He shouldn't have been thrown in jail in the first place... but he was so embarrassed to tell me and Nina about it, that we couldn't seek better legal counsel for him.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:11:53] lloyd:</b> He had to rely on a shitty public defender.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:12:05] lloyd:</b> By the time we found about this, it was too late.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:13:35] Vivian:</b> how did he take everything?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:14:00] lloyd:</b> He was tough. He was street-smart from a very early age. But jail is not a lark in the park.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:14:53] lloyd:</b> He emerged from it deeply chastened, but also scarred. The California penal system (as is the US system at large) one that bas been on the verge of crisis for a while now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:15:19] lloyd:</b> Overstuffed prisons, corruption, gangs, endemic violence.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:17:00] Vivian:</b> a lot of institutions are in crisis mode these days</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:17:07] Vivian:</b> hey lloyd on a side note</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:17:15] Vivian:</b> what do you know about the us going to war with iran?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:18:05] lloyd:</b> From the analysis and commentary I've read, it's not very likely, thank god. And it's almost a decision purely driven by economic factors.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:18:31] lloyd:</b> On the one hand, it's clear that Cheney and the inner circle neocons would like nothing better than to attack Iran.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:18:56] lloyd:</b> On the other hand, such a move would be economically disastrous to the US, in short order. And the heartland would be affected first, and directly.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:19:01] lloyd:</b> How?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:20:01] lloyd:</b> The price of oil would skyrocket, and the red states and those in between the East and West coasts, where car transportation is vital (and public transporation beyond weak), would suffer intensely.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:20:32] lloyd:</b> Given that calculation, the decision to bomb Iran definitely gives even the most rabid warhawks in the Bush Admin. serious pause.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:21:21] lloyd:</b> We would experience an economic recession almost instantly, and a depression would be quite possible.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:21:49] lloyd:</b> Iran controls the Straits of Hormuz where ALL the oil from the Arabian gulf states passes.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[03:22:59] lloyd:</b> Having said that, I still wouldn't put it past that evil dickhead Cheney to foment a war. They still have about 13 months left in power. That's a lot of time. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:23:11] Vivian:</b> yeah..</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:23:35] Vivian:</b> i've only heard a few people mention this</li>

	<li><b style="color:#9714B8">[03:26:13] Pono:</b> Hm. The lunatic left. ;p Unfortunately I don't put much stock in them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:26:28] Vivian:</b> lol i was just curious</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:26:38] Vivian:</b> she was a bit sensationalist about it</li>
	<li><b style="color:#9714B8">[03:28:28] Pono:</b> Alas, the era of coherent and meaningful political organizing on the Berkeley campus is past. And I have to say I have only the dimmest hopes that it can return in the future.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:29:15] Vivian:</b> it's still present</li>
	<li><b style="color:#9714B8">[03:29:15] Pono:</b> The vast majority of Cal students, brilliant as they are, are just not into political expression on a large and meaningful scale. Not like it was, from the 60s through the mid-80s.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#9714B8">[03:29:29] Pono:</b> It's present... in caricature form.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:29:36] Vivian:</b> but then overall it was a different time</li>
	<li><b style="color:#7E4E76">[03:29:39] Vivian:</b> there were so many movements</li>
