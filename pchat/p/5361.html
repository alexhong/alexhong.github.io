	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:36:47] lloyd:</b> For depositors or account holders, one's bank being sold has no immediate consequence. What would be scary though would be a rumor that a bank might be going under (very possible with many banks now), causing a run on its holdings. Many depositors WILL lose out in such a run.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:39:07] Kass:</b> So what happens in either situation.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:40:43] Forward Biased:</b> hmm... I need to read more up on that</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:41:01] lloyd:</b> Well, the acquiring bank certainly gets a LOT wealthier, to begin with.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:41:14] Forward Biased:</b> yeah...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:41:17] lloyd:</b> JP Morgan, for instance, instantly raised 10Billion in stock...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:42:00] Forward Biased:</b> well, JP Morgan <i>is</i> making a killing this year</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:42:37] lloyd:</b> JPM's balance sheet will be quite robust. BUT... if the credit crunch continues unabated, it won't take long for them to lose any massive gains from the acquisition.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:43:45] Forward Biased:</b> they gained 5400 stores overnight though</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:44:08] lloyd:</b> I think it's useful to look at the 700B bailout as an injection of confidence into the banking system. That's basically what's been causing all these investment banking collapses. A failure of confidence in their ability to continue the, uhm... derivatives shell game. ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:44:25] Forward Biased:</b> alright, I better sleep now! We'll talk more bank stuff tomorrow!</li>
	<li class="presence">[00:44:30] Forward Biased left.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#6B824A">[00:44:35] AIDA:</b> Hey guys, did you know that forwardbiased's last q-zar experience is having to go back to reload all the time because I kept getting hit?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:45:04] lloyd:</b> Haven't you talked to your mom yet, Kass, about all this? </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:45:58] Kass:</b> Uh, why would I?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:46:02] lloyd:</b> China has a very intimate connection to the whole thing. Interestingly, if the US economy fails, they do too. In a huge way.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:46:14] Kass:</b> I think my mom is IN China at the moment.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:46:15] lloyd:</b> Ergo, affecting your mom's business directly. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:46:35] Kass:</b> Don't see what your point is.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:46:36] lloyd:</b> The US is China's biggest market, and China holds trillions in US Treasury bonds. </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:46:39] Kass:</b> She wouldn't talk to me about business.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:46:44] lloyd:</b> It also is the U.S.' biggest creditor.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:46:45] Kass:</b> And I wouldn't listen even if she did.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:47:24] lloyd:</b> Well, considering that she's your bank of first instance (as far as paying for your education)... seems to me logical that you'd be interested.</li>
	<li class="status">[00:47:37] Max went away.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:48:35] lloyd:</b> Neat: Cindy loves SD: <a href="http://128.32.250.16/sakuradragon/">sakuradragon</a></li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:49:53] Kass:</b> Lord Lloyd... there are too many things happening in the world to understand and be interested and worry about all of them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:50:16] lloyd:</b> True. But this one is of paramount concern, seems to me. Since it affects everyone's bottom line.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:51:03] lloyd:</b> To my mind, the banking crisis trumps the election, in terms of importance. And you know how I feel about the election. ;p</li>
	<li class="presence">[00:51:52] MyNamelsFrank left.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#6B824A">[00:51:57] AIDA:</b> Hey guys, did you know that mynamelsfrank's dl speed is taunting me?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:56] Kass:</b> Anyway... I'm not inclined to believe anything my mother says, especially about business matters.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:53:22] Kass:</b> She has an exceptionally bad habit of saying whatever the heck she wants to get her point across, so I don't really find truth coming out of her all that often.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:53:39] lloyd:</b> lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:54:40] lloyd:</b> I don't feel that the US will spiral down into another Great Depression. Just a prolonged, if deep, recession. But if it does (and a great many sober-minded economists do say that the probability of that is non-trivial) ... then I'll warn you to leave the LA area immediately. ;p I don't think you want to be caught in the middle of a place where lots of people will be &quot;restive&quot; (to say the least).</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:56:58] Kass:</b> Mmph.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:58:09] lloyd:</b> How far are you from South-Central, anyway? Mere blocks, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:58:28] Kass:</b> I guess.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:00:28] lloyd:</b> I hope you'll trust my instincts on this. ;p But also trust your own social antennae and powers of observation. And I'm not being dramatic here really. Just practical.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:02:08] lloyd:</b> I often find myself wishing I'd wake up tomorrow and things will be the same as ever. But these rapid and startling macro-economic developments belie that fantasy. Anyway, bottom line: far better to be prepared. And if that comes at the cost of a little bit of hysterical hyperventilating now, I can live with that. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:03:46] lloyd:</b> I can tell you with complete honesty, though, how I've come to this point: what my brother and I have been discussing in private (mostly) for the past 8 or so years, has come to pass with uncanny accuracy. (Quad knows how true this is, since I started talking to him about it a few years ago.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:04:01] lloyd:</b> So, facts and events are supporting what used to be mere hypothesizing.</li>
	<li class="status">[01:05:34] Max returned.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:07:37] lloyd:</b> Oh and it's certainly not the case that I agree with my bro about everything. We have steep differences regarding political solutions. He's a Ron Paulite 'revolutionary' libertarian, where I'm quite a bit more orthodox, with my support of Obama and the Dems. Bro thinks Obama is no different from any other establishment politician. (Which is true to some extent; but I would rather believe that Obama will at least try to make a difference, and really means what he says about enacting change, from a leadership role.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:08:46] lloyd:</b> It's exciting, in a way, to have this particular nexus of events: the rise of Obama and the possibility of real change in the way politics goes in America today, at exactly the same time as the economic system threatens to break down.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:37] lloyd:</b> It's theoretically thrilling, but I'm afraid real-world consequences will be painful. I always feel a twinge of fear looking at my kids, and wondering how they might cope, in the event of a real crash.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:13:49] lloyd:</b> Okay, Pono and his friend will be out of the movie soon... and my MBA is down to 13% batt. Taking my leave. Goodnight, all!</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:42:02] lloyd:</b> But if she DOES make it to the debate (i.e., McCain doesn't dump her before then), I'm willing to bet all my sweet potatoes that the resulting debacle will cause a shitstorm the next day.
