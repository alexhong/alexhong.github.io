	<li><b>[02:20:56] aqhong:</b> The logical part of me knew he wouldn't get shot :P</li>
	<li><b>[02:21:08] aqhong:</b> It's just a sort of... subconscious reaction or something, I guess.</li>
	<li><b>[02:22:54] aqhong:</b> I'm (re)reading the Wikipedia article, and the thing about press coverage is interesting... I remember seeing it online before I saw it on TV too.</li>
	<li><b>[02:23:39] aqhong:</b> Interesting how the live audience reaction and the online reception were so different...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:24:07] lloyd:</b> Well, it's because the live audience was THE target. ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b>[02:24:17] aqhong:</b> Yeah, that's true.</li>
	<li><b>[02:24:44] aqhong:</b> Which is why it was, to quote Jon Stewart, &quot;ballsalicious&quot; :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:25:15] lloyd:</b> There was a time when journalism (and journalists) was an honorable profession. It's not that long ago, really. But yeah, before you guys wre born, I suppose.</li>
	<li><b>[02:25:25] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:26:01] lloyd:</b> But at least, the news were reported on in ways that had integrity. Now, it's all questionable, isn't it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:26:46] lloyd:</b> There's a good chance we can get that back, though. And it'll be via the internet.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:27:20] lloyd:</b> One easy target: the ownership of the mass media ... the conglomerization of media companies.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:28:00] lloyd:</b> I've always found it amusing how the rightwing casts the media as liberal..</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:28:19] lloyd:</b> ...and liberals cast the media as conservative. (In general terms)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:28:40] lloyd:</b> The truth is squarely in between, as is usually the case.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:29:06] lloyd:</b> Journalists themselves are a largely liberal crowd. But the containers in which they operate... are deeply conservative things.</li>
	<li><b>[02:29:08] aqhong:</b> Well, I consider myself liberal, and I think the media is generally pretty liberal too.</li>
	<li><b>[02:29:15] aqhong:</b> With the obvious exception of FOX.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:30:11] lloyd:</b> Yes and no. It's really subtle. And all-encompassing. The big story is how media companies have been concentrated in the hands of a few owners.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:34:07] lloyd:</b> When the internet came into its own, I could clearly see a tool whereby we now could &quot;unbrainwash&quot; ourselves. The participatory aspect of the medium was the key.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:34:34] lloyd:</b> Which is why the conglomerates coopting parts of the internet is a big issue.</li>
	<li><b>[02:35:31] aqhong:</b> Did you hear about thing about Comcast at the FCC hearing?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:35:34] lloyd:</b> We're actually now down to just six. SIX huge corporations, controlling the mainstream media.</li>
