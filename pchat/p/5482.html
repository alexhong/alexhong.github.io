	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:56:50] Kass:</b> No, not really.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:56:59] Kass:</b> You have to make a separate login for every log you join.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:57:09] lloyd:</b> Oh. Right.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:57:16] Kass:</b> Whereas TypeKey is designed to work with all different logs that... support TypeKey.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:57:21] Kass:</b> But you only need one login.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:58:16] Kass:</b> Anyway... TypeKey's a good idea. But there's that whole standard system competition thing. If you have ONE group in charge of ALL the logins... ::shrug::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:59:39] Kass:</b> On the other hand... what might be good is if there were several systems that performed the same kind of service... and new weblog system writers should just implement all of them, or the biggest ones.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:59:51] Kass:</b> Kind of like credit cards. :x</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:00:18] Kass:</b> And people could choose their service and try to get the weblogs they frequent to turn on the support for different systems.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:00:30] lloyd:</b> Great idea actually. Patent it!</li>
	<li><b>[16:00:36] aqhong:</b> LOL.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:00:38] Kass:</b> Go away Lloyd. :(</li>
	<li><b>[16:00:54] aqhong:</b> &quot;Wow, good site! Thanks! Go patent it! &quot;:O</li>
	<li class="presence">[16:01:45] awcchungster left.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:02:23] lloyd:</b> No seriously. Has anyone thought of that before? Maybe someone has... but no one seems to be implementing it.</li>
	<li class="presence">[16:02:48] awcchungster joined.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:02:57] Kass:</b> Implementing what, exactly? :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:03:08] lloyd:</b> The system you just described.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:03:15] Kass:</b> That's not a single system.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:03:43] Kass:</b> That's just basic software interaction principles, for lack of better term.</li>
	<li><b>[16:03:49] aqhong:</b> If every person with a weblog were to pick and choose from a dozen different services, wouldn't that necessitate a user signing up at a good number of those?</li>
	<li><b>[16:03:58] aqhong:</b> How is that better than having to sign up at one, like TypeKey?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:04:18] Kass:</b> The point is that you have to get the system of signing up for an identity at a particular company to be the &quot;standard&quot; way of doing things.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:04:33] Kass:</b> And then there has to be several companies that are big enough for most weblog software to write support for.</li>
	<li><b>[16:04:49] aqhong:</b> And pick which ones to support? :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:04:51] Kass:</b> Again, using the credit card example... you have several credit card companies... Visa, American Express, MasterCard.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:05:15] Kass:</b> All of these are big enough that they are basically supported by anything that you could possibly imagine to use them for.</li>
	<li><b>[16:05:19] aqhong:</b> And signing up for and maintaining multiple credit cards isn't a hassle at all :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:05:31] Kass:</b> I don't have multiple credit cards.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:05:33] Kass:</b> I just have Visa.</li>
	<li><b>[16:05:39] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:05:59] Kass:</b> My point is that, there's nothing you couldn't accomplish with any one of those cards.</li>
	<li><b>[16:06:07] aqhong:</b> So wait... how is that better than just one big company like TypeKey?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:06:33] Kass:</b> I believe economics historically shows that having one big system handle everything is generally a bad idea. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:06:53] Kass:</b> Monopoly and lack of competition results in a poorer standard of service over time.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:07:12] Kass:</b> In addition, if it's just one big company, that makes it one fat target.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#146AB8">[16:07:18] awcchungster:</b> man i shoulda never said anything</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:07:20] Kass:</b> And it would only take one well planned attack to really fsk things up.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:07:22] lloyd:</b> That's about as good a description of the Soviet command economics system there is. ;p</li>
	<li class="status">[16:07:29] awcchungster went away: sulking myself into katie</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:07:40] lloyd:</b> Alright. That Katie thing...</li>
	<li><b>[16:07:54] aqhong:</b> So you're just saying we should have a bunch of TypeKey clones that do the same thing, but are all owned by different people.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:08:12] lloyd:</b> ... nm.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:08:15] Kass:</b> I'm not saying that's what we SHOULD do, but that it seems to be the neutral solution.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:08:35] Kass:</b> That's the capitalism-friendly solution. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:01] Kass:</b> Technically speaking, I'm all for one single standard... for basically everything in computing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:09:10] lloyd:</b> Are we certain that spammers wouldn't find a workaround for it?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:16] Kass:</b> As far as I'm concerned, PCs and Macs can boh go to hell. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:19] Kass:</b> both, even</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:29] Kass:</b> If it were in favor of ONE single type of platform that everybody could use.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:40] Kass:</b> I'd say to hell with a variety of different browsers.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:47] Kass:</b> I'd say a lot of things like that, to get standards.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:51] Kass:</b> Because standards are easier to write rules for.</li>
	<li><b>[16:09:53] aqhong:</b> But what about innovation? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:56] Kass:</b> There. See?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:09:58] Kass:</b> No innovation.</li>
	<li><b>[16:10:01] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:10:11] lloyd:</b> PCs and Macs can go to hell... as long as the standard is along the lines of OS X. ;-)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:10:15] Kass:</b> That's why it will never happen.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:10:26] Kass:</b> Or maybe why it shouldn't happen.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:11:06] Kass:</b> It's frustrating to realize that innovation won't occur when everybody's using the same thing. Because it'd make it EASIER to be innovative, but no one will bother trying.</li>
	<li><b>[16:11:21] aqhong:</b> Welcome to human nature :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:11:26] lloyd:</b> Scifi writers have already dealt with that scenario... with alien cultures that don't have a multiplicity of religious beliefs... just one. Which can be quite frightening, really.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:13:07] Kass:</b> Anyway. My position on this is pretty clear, right? :P I'm not pro ... anything we currently have.</li>
	<li><b>[16:13:21] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:13:52] Kass:</b> Even if we threw out every variation of things, I still wouldn't be happy, right? Because there wouldn't be any new stuff happening either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:14:06] Kass:</b> That's why written standards end up being so important.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:14:16] Kass:</b> Like XHTML 1.0 and CSS2 and whatnot standards.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:14:39] Kass:</b> Because worthy browsers will implement those and they will still have room to innovate on the side, if they so desire.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:14:52] Kass:</b> Likewise, you would want a standard for things like TypeKey.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:17:31] Kass:</b> Just can't help but think that the bigger the corporation is, the more decisions are made based on profit.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:17:37] Kass:</b> Not on what will benefit humans as a whole.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:17:53] Kass:</b> Politics is much too confusing, so I won't even delve into that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:19:22] lloyd:</b> Large corporations don't necessarily function to profit their stockholders (see: Enron). They serve to enrich their owners and executives first, employers and workers a distant second.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:19:48] Kass:</b> Well sure.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:20:09] Kass:</b> If they were actually thinking about humans as a whole, they'd be trying to create profit for the mass of their company... not just the heads.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:22:27] Kass:</b> Anyway, to answer your question above, Lloyd... about spammers not finding a way around a centralized system...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:22:42] Kass:</b> The idea is that everyone has to register an ID to post comments in the first place.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:22:55] Kass:</b> If an ID is recognized to be sending spam, it's banned.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:23:18] lloyd:</b> Right...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:23:20] Kass:</b> Spammers can create new IDs, sure, but they'll be banned as soon as a few people see that they're doing it... which makes their ID useless against ALL logs that are using that system.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:23:42] lloyd:</b> ...but in terms of the banking/credit card example, there probably would surface an analog to identity theft, that spammers can use.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:23:55] Kass:</b> Sure, probably.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:24:53] Kass:</b> Is that supposed to discourage people from using such a system in the first place? </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:25:11] Kass:</b> Or I'm not sure what your point is. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:25:20] lloyd:</b> No, not at all, since the value of using the system weighs more than the risk.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[16:25:51] lloyd:</b> My point is that spammers could well find a workaround (identity theft), but then the system would then find a way to combat that, as well. (The way banks do.)</li>
