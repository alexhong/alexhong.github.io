	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:10:33] Kass:</b> You could easily argue that the mythbusters didn't actually perform the experiment correctly.</li>
	<li><b>[01:10:35] aqhong:</b> Makes sense...</li>
	<li><b>[01:10:43] aqhong:</b> Yeah, I see what he's saying now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:10:46] Kass:</b> The PLANE's speed is 25 mph and the car's speed was 25 mph...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:10:56] Kass:</b> But since the plane was moving forward, the wheels had to be moving more than 25 MPH.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:11:32] Kass:</b> Because you have to be going 25 mph to just cancel out... and then more to be going forward.</li>
	<li><b>[01:11:53] aqhong:</b> Basically just this: &quot;However, if the plane does move forward, then the wheels must necessarily be rotating forward faster than the treadmill is moving backwards, contradicting the premise.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:12:48] Kass:</b> Yeah...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:14:04] Kass:</b> Um.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:14:26] Kass:</b> So what Kenton is actually saying is that the people who say the plane will take off are not paying attention to the actual premise posed by the question. :P</li>
	<li><b>[01:15:00] aqhong:</b> Eh, I guess.</li>
	<li><b>[01:15:25] aqhong:</b> but ignoring the self-contradictory nature of the premise, it'll take off in a real-world situation.</li>
	<li><b>[01:15:28] aqhong:</b> Good enough :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:15:54] Kass:</b> We don't know that. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:05] Kass:</b> Mythbusters should have run the truck at a higher speed than the plane.</li>
	<li><b>[01:16:06] aqhong:</b> Yeah, we do. Mythbusters did it :O</li>
	<li><b>[01:16:17] aqhong:</b> It doesn't matter how fast they ran it...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:26] Kass:</b> Did they try it at higher speeds?</li>
	<li><b>[01:16:27] aqhong:</b> They could've run it twice as fast, but the plane would've still moved forward.</li>
	<li><b>[01:16:35] aqhong:</b> And therefore would've been going faster.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:53] Kass:</b> That doesn't seem possible. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[01:17:05] aqhong:</b> Basically, the fact that the plane is able to take off makes it impossible for the speeds to match.</li>
	<li><b>[01:17:10] aqhong:</b> That's what Kenton is saying.</li>
	<li><b>[01:17:20] aqhong:</b> But the premise says that the speeds should match.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:17:53] Kass:</b> Oh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:18:16] Kass:</b> ... so if the plane was at 25 and the conveyor belt was at 50, the wheels would be going more than 50? :P</li>
	<li><b>[01:18:25] aqhong:</b> Yeah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:18:41] Kass:</b> That seems so wrong. :P</li>
	<li><b>[01:18:47] aqhong:</b> Why?</li>
	<li><b>[01:18:56] aqhong:</b> If it seems wrong, you still haven't really gotten it...</li>
	<li><b>[01:19:11] aqhong:</b> As long as the wheels can handle the friction of rotating that fast, it doesn't matter how fast the conveyor belt moves.</li>
	<li><b>[01:20:07] aqhong:</b> The propeller/engine is what propels a plane forward, and it works the exact same way regardless of what's happening with the wheels, which just spin freely.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:20:22] Kass:</b> I guess.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:20:38] Kass:</b> I feel like there should be some kind of drag force or something.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:21:05] Kass:</b> Aida, what do you know about propeller/engine?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#6B824A">[01:21:10] AIDA:</b> Don't know much, but I do know the propeller/engine is what propels a plane forward.</li>
	<li><b>[01:21:37] aqhong:</b> There is a negligible effect of the friction on the wheels.</li>
	<li><b>[01:21:47] aqhong:</b> But it's nowhere near enough to stop the plane from taking off.</li>

	<li><b>[01:29:53] aqhong:</b> Because of our pesky laws of physics :O</li>
	<li><b>[01:30:34] aqhong:</b> I think the question is brilliant, though, because it's set up so you have both sides arguing completely past each other.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:45] Kass:</b> Oh, what, Straight Dope gave an answer?</li>
	<li><b>[01:31:58] aqhong:</b> Everybody understands the physics correctly, they just don't understand this particular question. Which isn't a surprise, since the question is flawed, and Kenton put it...</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:33:19] Kass:</b> This language leads to a paradox: If the plane moves forward at 5 MPH, then its wheels will do likewise, and the treadmill will go 5 MPH backward. But if the treadmill is going 5 MPH backward, then the wheels are really turning 10 MPH forward. But if the wheels are going 10 MPH forward . . . Soon the foolish have persuaded themselves that the treadmill must operate at infinite speed. </li>
	<li><b>[01:33:35] aqhong:</b> Yep.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:33:43] Kass:</b> Well that sucks. &gt;_&gt;</li>

	<li><b>[01:38:42] aqhong:</b> &quot;The plane moves forward at roughly its usual speed relative to the ground and air, generates lift, and takes off. Many people have a hard time grasping this (although it can be easily demonstrated in the lab), but eventually they do, smack their foreheads, and move on. We'll call this Basic Realization #1.<br>Message-board discussions of this question tend to feature a lot of posters who haven't yet arrived at BR #1 talking right past those who have, insisting more and more loudly that the plane won't take off. &quot;</li>
