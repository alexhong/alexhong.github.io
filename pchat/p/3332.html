	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:24:51] lloyd:</b> Chelsea was here on Maui this weekend.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:27:47] lloyd:</b> Glad you read it!</li>
	<li><b>[22:28:13] aqhong:</b> Honestly, if Obama doesn't win this election, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to bring myself to care about politics again.

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:31:37] lloyd:</b> The only question is whether he beats McCain by a landslide, or narrowly. I'm still thinking narrowly, actually. The GOP machine is not to be underestimated.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:32:11] lloyd:</b> The more interesting thing to me is Obama's potential coattails... how much the Dems can solidify their hold on Congress.</li>
	<li><b>[22:33:00] aqhong:</b> I think this pretty much nails it: &quot;While hope and change are the mantra of the Obama movement, at its core, it is undergirded by trust. Obama supporters trust him, and he has gone a long way to cultivate that trust. The extraordinary thing about Barack Obama is not the poetry with which he aspires to hope, change, and political realignment: it is that fundamentally, people believe him.&quot;</li>
