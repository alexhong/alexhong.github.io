	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:41:25] Kass:</b> You compared it to one basically. Or any e-mail that asks you to unsubscribe or whatever.</li>
	<li><b>[17:42:28] aqhong:</b> That was an analogy... I wasn't saying anything about subscription email services.</li>
	<li><b>[17:42:36] aqhong:</b> And I didn't say any email.</li>
	<li><b>[17:42:39] aqhong:</b> I said spam.</li>
