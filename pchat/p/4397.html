	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:31:54] Kass:</b> Ideally, there shouldn't be an &quot;ideal&quot; personality. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:32:21] Kass:</b> Sure, but that's how it's supposed to be for all of the NPCs. It's my fault that they weren't balanced as such.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:33:17] Kass:</b> I suppose more importantly, the fact that Alex snagged Umaro before anyone else... it didn't make you hate him or not want to group with him, did it? :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:34:44] Max:</b> Hm, well, just because it didn't escalate doesn't mean it should be encouraged? I don't think it's too big an issue in playtesting anyway</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:35:37] Kass:</b> ::lol::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:36:53] Kass:</b> Anyway.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:37:09] Kass:</b> I think for now, I'm going to say no to gambits.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:37:27] Kass:</b> Because I think it complicates things unnecessarily... for the time being.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:37:52] Kass:</b> Hummm.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:37:57] Kass:</b> What kinds of gambits were there?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:38:04] Kass:</b> Besides like... at x%, cast cure?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:38:18] Max:</b> Gambits are very specific... stuff like if weak to fire cast firaga</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:38:36] Kass:</b> ... And they automatically know that stuff, or you have to cast Scan first?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:38:44] Max:</b> They do automatically know it</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:38:49] Kass:</b> Holy shit. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:39:18] Max:</b> I even had gambits for them to buff themselves... I don't quite remember how it went though</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:39:31] Kass:</b> But my question about gambits is like...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:39:36] Kass:</b> How much do they REALLY vary, from player to player?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:39:43] Kass:</b> Who the hell is going to do, if weak to fire, cast ice? &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:40:51] Max:</b> Hm, I only remember this one fight that depended on you keeping up certain buffs on one character while the others did something completely different</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:41:02] Max:</b> That might have been the only instance where I had different gambits</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:41:17] Max:</b> Though the order or priority might have been different depending on character strengths</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:41:25] Kass:</b> Yeah, but like, wouldn't all players do that, just because that's the strategy that's required for that boss?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:41:34] Max:</b> Like, physical fighters don't even have attack magic gambits</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:42:09] Kass:</b> How much were you allowed to customize your party in FF12?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:42:17] Kass:</b> Was there a point where you could bring anyone you wanted?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:42:45] Max:</b> Er... what? You could pick any three playable characters to fight... I guess</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:43:14] Kass:</b> Hmm, so you could have three casters and then your gambits would have to change as a result of that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:44:18] Max:</b> ....I don't think so. I didn't change the gambits much after they were set up except for certain fights</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:44:36] Kass:</b> Hum. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:45:40] Kass:</b> I suppose I should see if there are personality stats that I could come up with that weren't specifically non/aggressive and see how that might affect the gameplay.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:46:30] Kass:</b> Isn't there an edition of Pokemon that has personalities?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:46:43] Max:</b> Pokemon natures affect stats</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:46:59] Kass:</b> And what are those, natures?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:47:03] Kass:</b> Give me some examples.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:47:14] Max:</b> Rash, timid, adamant, mild</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:47:23] Kass:</b> ::lol:: And they do what?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:47:45] Max:</b> Each nature raises a certain stat by a percentage and lowers another stat by a percentage</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:48:02] Max:</b> Players generally seek out natures that raise essential stats and lower useless ones... of course</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:48:54] Kass:</b> So what does that do essentially... it keeps people hunting for specific pokemon until they find the type they want (time sink) and results in yet more pokemon that have no use.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:49:22] Kass:</b> Will players use pokemon of a different nature than the one they want in the interim?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:49:51] Max:</b> Sometimes players change the nature to confuse other players. But that's pretty much it</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:50:14] Kass:</b> What does that mean. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:50:15] Max:</b> Sometimes players get tired of searching for the right combination of natures and hidden stat modifications and just go with a suboptimal nature</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:51:13] Kass:</b> ... Hm.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:51:18] Max:</b> It means that a pokemon with a potential speed of X that moves faster than a pokemon with potential speed Y may have its speed be less than X (and Y) to secure a one-hit KO on another pokemon</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:51:44] Kass:</b> O_o</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:52:16] Max:</b> Basically you sacrifice the ability to go first for the ability to KO another pokemon in one hit</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:52:29] Kass:</b> Mmph.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:52:37] Kass:</b> Let's talk about Pokemon for a second.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:52:42] Kass:</b> Or more than a few seconds.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:52:54] Kass:</b> Originally Pokemon started out as a completely typed battle system, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:53:10] Kass:</b> Pokemon didn't have stats... just a type, HP, and level.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:53:11] Max:</b> Hm, I suppose</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:53:17] Max:</b> Oh, no it always had stats</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:53:21] Kass:</b> Did they?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:53:35] Max:</b> Yeah, though some stats were combined with each other</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:53:47] Kass:</b> What were the original stats? I'm talking red/blue.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:54:13] Max:</b> HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special, I believe</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:54:29] Kass:</b> ::lol:: Shit, don't remember any of this.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:54:56] Kass:</b> What did Special do?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:55:14] Max:</b> Special was overpowered in that moves that raised Special Attack also raised Special Defense, that's why it was later split into Special Attack and Special Defense</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:55:45] Kass:</b> Yeah... don't remember this at all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:56:28] Kass:</b> So on top of that, every ability in Pokemon is typed.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:56:39] Kass:</b> And physical is a type.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:56:43] Max:</b> Back then, there wasn't a physical/special split for moves so which stat the move depended on depended on its type</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:57:12] Max:</b> So like rock, normal, fighting attacks and etc depended on attack/defense. Fire, water, leaf, etc. depended on special</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:57:31] Kass:</b> Oh, interesting.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:57:36] Kass:</b> So they were like melee/casters.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:57:52] Max:</b> Er... in a sense</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:58:29] Kass:</b> Well. Did a special attack get mitigated by the defense value no matter what?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:59:03] Max:</b> Special mitigated Special</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:59:21] Kass:</b> Yeah, okay.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[16:59:23] Max:</b> At the time, Special was both Special Attack and Special Defense, yeah</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[16:59:47] Kass:</b> Gotcha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:00:44] Kass:</b> I suppose I should just make physical into a type.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:01:20] Kass:</b> Hummmm. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:01:26] Kass:</b> This is so tricky and complicated. x_x</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:02:28] Kass:</b> so the way it was in the prototype... what I had planned out beyond what you guys reached... five elements for magic and physical which just ... had no special qualities at all, which may be inadvisable now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:04:21] Kass:</b> So maybe for types, I should try... physical, fire, water, earth, air, nature. Though that kind of says nature and physical are opposites. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[17:05:44] Max:</b> Just call it nonelemental :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:06:29] Kass:</b> And then stats...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:06:46] Kass:</b> ;_;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:07:50] Kass:</b> ::lol:: Hmm.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:09:27] Kass:</b> I guess I'm going to have to temporarily sacrifice my narrative.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[17:09:29] Max:</b> ...ugh, this place was red an hour ago and now it's blue &gt;_&gt;. No other skylands are red either... don't want to fly more...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:09:52] Kass:</b> Or else we're developing the &quot;world of ruin&quot; rules.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:11:09] Kass:</b> Dude, I want to move our wing to Leng. :O</li>

	<li><b style="color:#686564">[17:13:02] Max:</b> Leng is so out there. I haven't been there yet</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[17:14:32] Kass:</b> That can't be a coincidence. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[17:15:08] Max:</b> Nnn... wait at Phillipia for the stock to go back down or fly 3 and a half more hours in the dark to Tehras.... mmmm</li>
