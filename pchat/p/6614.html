With the latter, there's time to get used to it, don't you think? And to try various things to counteract the normal aspects of aging? (Like keeping one's mind sharp, e.g.)</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[18:01:00] lloyd:</b> Well, I was going to say that these longtime matchmaker things that I do have always been about friendship. Not romance. Surely y'all have seen that, from long ago? I don't do romance. But I certainly do friendship. :-)</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[18:01:40] lloyd:</b> I've looked at the ATDP/TIC community as a wonderful arena for the growing of friendship. It's natural.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[18:02:14] lloyd:</b> You really want to go public on certain things? I have a feeling others might not like that. ;-)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:02:50] Kass:</b> I don't need to go public. There's nothing in your insinuation 90% of the time that means &quot;oh, I think those two will be good friends&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:03:06] Kass:</b> That's *never* what you say. &gt;_&lt;</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[18:03:30] lloyd:</b> So anyway, while it's natural for friendships to occur in the ATDP landscape, sometimes a nudge is necessary for it to grow.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[18:04:04] lloyd:</b> And here's the thing: if romance does blossom, why, I'm all for that, too. ::chuckle::</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:54] Kass:</b> Obviously ATDP is fertile ground for friendships to grow, but I REALLY do not believe that &quot;pairing&quot; them romantically is the way to go about it.</li>
