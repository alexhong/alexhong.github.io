	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:05:34] Kass:</b> <span>But the point is, if you let them do design another cover, there's a chance they'll produce something better and you'll be left in the same dilemma.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:05:49] Kass:</b> <span>If there's any reason to believe that you have to reserve the ED cover for Akiko for diplomatic reasons, then just don't produce an LT one.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:05:55] lloyd:</b> <span>Not a dilemma, since the decision will have been made beforehand...</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:06:08] lloyd:</b> <span>...that Akiko, for better or for worse (most likely worse) will do the ED cover.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:06:18] lloyd:</b> <span>And the ED LT thing will be for fun/play.</span></li>

	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:07:59] lloyd:</b> <span>Basically, if all think it a waste of time to do ED cover LT...</span></li>

	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:08:08] Kass:</b> <span>It's not that it's a &quot;waste of time&quot;.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:08:14] lloyd:</b> <span>I don't think it's a waste of time, as it's fun and pleasurable.</span></li>

	<li class="say"><b>[17:08:26] aqhong:</b> <span>Good practice :O</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:08:27] Kass:</b> <span>It's the fact that afterwards, if you've produced something better, you're going to regret going with a lesser quality choice for the actual thing.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:08:39] lloyd:</b> <span>No, I'm not. It's not THAT important. lol.</span></li>

	<li class="say"><b>[17:08:58] aqhong:</b> <span>Haha, that's more like my attitude ;)</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:09:32] Kass:</b> <span>I personally have been in plenty of situations in which I'll put something out and then later come up with a better way... and can't rectify my original for whatever reason.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:10:01] lloyd:</b> <span>It's just that a staffer's sanity and peace of mind is at stake, and that's not comparable to &quot;waste of time&quot; on the student designers' part.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:10:08] lloyd:</b> <span>So, I'm going with staffer's sanity. ;p</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:10:24] lloyd:</b> <span>Even though that's sure to produce a cover that's less elegant.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:10:39] lloyd:</b> <span>Well, maybe not 100% sure, but close.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:10:41] Kass:</b> <span>I don't think you understand what my emphasis is, here.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:10:50] lloyd:</b> <span>Go on?</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:11:21] Kass:</b> <span>I agree that, for diplomatic reasons, it'd be best not to completely throw out Akiko's designs.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:12:35] Kass:</b> <span>On the other hand, on a professional level, it bothers me that people would choose to sacrifice a little of the quality of a project in order to preserve team members' feelings.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:12:49] lloyd:</b> <span>That's the real world for ya.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b>[17:12:53] aqhong:</b> <span>lol.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:13:21] Kass:</b> <span>No, but I mean... if Akiko knew that you had designed an ED cover and that we knew it was better, but still chose to use her cover... how would she feel about that?</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b>[17:13:21] aqhong:</b> <span>Is this tangentially relevant to what Quad posted about? ;)</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:13:39] lloyd:</b> <span>Well, that's the thing. She would not know about it.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:13:41] Kass:</b> <span>It's relevant in that it's about quality, but not about time.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:13:50] lloyd:</b> <span>All she would know is that there has been a design suggested for the SD.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:13:57] lloyd:</b> <span>And that she can have responsibility for the ED cover.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:13:57] Kass:</b> <span>I know she's not to know about that.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:14:03] Kass:</b> <span>But if she DID know about it, how would she feel?</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:14:40] lloyd:</b> <span>I think...</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:15:19] lloyd:</b> <span>...at first she'd feel upset, yes. Which is why it's kinda important that she not know.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:16:19] Kass:</b> <span>Sure, but see, if I were in her place and I was informed that there was a better quality cover... I would never, ever, ever insist that my own, lesser quality one be used.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:16:37] Kass:</b> <span>I imagine she wouldn't insist either.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:16:41] lloyd:</b> <span>I imagine so.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:16:57] lloyd:</b> <span>And she'd still feel upset that she was upstaged lke that.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:17:14] Kass:</b> <span>Maybe this is about honesty more than anything else, but I don't see why you should deceive her about an ED cover being produced.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:17:16] lloyd:</b> <span>I was really hoping that she hadn't started yet, though that doesn't resolve the issue fully.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:17:46] lloyd:</b> <span>What deception? It's not like we've asked the students independently to produce something else.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:18:41] lloyd:</b> <span>But I agree. The upshot is I'm not going to be completely honest with Akiko... for her own peace of mind. Though I really could be wrong about this. She may well not mind.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:18:52] lloyd:</b> <span>But... judging from our chat this morning, I really do think she would.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:19:25] lloyd:</b> <span>One of the reasons we hired her was because of her interest (and budding skill) in graphic design.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:19:25] Kass:</b> <span>... Sigh. I'm not getting through. Oh well.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:19:49] lloyd:</b> <span>I think I hear you saying that ED LT should not go ahead.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:19:51] Kass:</b> <span>I merely don't think that anything useful would come out of designing an ED cover for LT, even for the exercise. You can just pick anything freaking else for LT.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#438851">[17:20:17] lloyd:</b> <span>Well, I guess that can be put up for a voice vote.</span></li>
	<li class="say"><b style="color:#336699">[17:20:38] Kass:</b> <span>Whereas if people did do ED LT, everyone will agree that it wouldn't be used, but we're still going to feel just a little bitter that the better item is not being used for the sake of sparing someone's feelings.</span></li>
