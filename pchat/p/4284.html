	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:14:51] lloyd:</b> Commentators are picking up on McCain's refusal to make eye contact with Obama. This is gonna be his (McCain's) Gore &quot;sighing&quot; moment.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:17:27] lloyd:</b> Contempt, absolutely. The guy has no shame left in his wizened, tortured, bones.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:17:50] lloyd:</b> My guess: he ditches Palin, for maybe Romney or some other pathetic sap.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:20:39] lloyd:</b> Reader comment at Talking Points Memo (small wall of text):</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:20:44] lloyd:</b> As a psychotherapist and someone who treats people with anger management problems, we typically try to educate people that anger is often an emotion that masks other emotions. I think it's significant that McCain didn't make much, if any, eye contact because it suggests one of two things to me; he doesn't want to make eye contact because he is prone to losing control of his emotions if he deals directly with the other person, or, his anger masks fear and the eye contact may increase or substantiate the fear.<br>I noticed him doing the same thing in the Republican primary debates. The perception observers are likely to have is that he is unwilling to acknowledge the opponent's legitimacy and/or is contemptuous of the opponent.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:22:00] lloyd:</b> I think people really are missing the point about McCain's failure to look at Obama. McCain was afraid of Obama. It was really clear--look at how much McCain blinked in the first half hour. I study monkey behavior--low ranking monkeys don't look at high ranking monkeys. In a physical, instinctive sense, Obama owned McCain tonight and I think the instant polling reflects that.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:29:15] Kass:</b> That JUST happened, though, right? :P</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:30:05] Kass:</b> So are banks being bought / joining up because... what?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:30:11] Forward Biased:</b> oh yeah, Lloyd... before JP Morgan's conference call, all the news outlets were saying JP Morgan bought out WaMu's operations...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:30:14] lloyd:</b> I think it can boil down to this equation: credit seizing up means inflation down the road, for us regular people. (The question, of course, is why credit is getting tight to begin with. And that would require a semester-long refresher on macro-economics and the history of the last 10 years.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:30:34] Forward Biased:</b> only afterwards did they announce it was a government seizure</li>

	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:31:21] Forward Biased:</b> that day though, WaMu tumbled while everything else went up. I guess that's the tell.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:32:50] lloyd:</b> ...most likely not from foreign central banks and others buying Treasury bonds.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:32:51] Kass:</b> I don't even understand what the circumstances of a bank being bought would be, what it implies, etc.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:33:13] lloyd:</b> But Bernanke hinted as much: they're going to just continue printing money out of thin air.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:33:29] lloyd:</b> Meaning, soon enough, inflation. Perhaps even hyper-inflation.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:33:54] Forward Biased:</b> a bank would sell itself if it didn't have enough money to continue operating</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:34:05] lloyd:</b> (Also, we're not getting out of Iraq soon enough, so any savings from that debacle won't count for a while.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:34:48] lloyd:</b> (Besides, Cheney is definitely angling for a new war in the area. Again, likely with Pakistan. Would be a heinous development all in all.)</li>

	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:36:29] Forward Biased:</b> depends on if they bought the bank straight-up or waited for the Fed to seize the bank's first...</li>
