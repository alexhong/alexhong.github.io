	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:56:41] lloyd:</b> ...then all meaning is moot. And psychic chaos reigns.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:56:57] lloyd:</b> It was like the time he was punched out by those drunken hooligans at the bar, and his iPhone stolen.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:57:16] lloyd:</b> He was being too kind, to a fault. Why come to the defense of someone he didn't even know?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:57:36] lloyd:</b> It was like that, then, with her. He was coming to the defense of an indefensible idea (at least to her mind, it was).</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:58:08] lloyd:</b> But in the realm of passion, nothing is irrational. Everything is grist for the romantic mill.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:58:25] lloyd:</b> He took that advice to heart, but then didn't know how to act on it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:58:40] lloyd:</b> Beyond the obvious, I found it baffling.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:59:12] lloyd:</b> Why didn't he know not to call her quite THEN? There are times you feel are right, and as someone who had been with someone else for that amount of time, he shoulda known. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:59:41] lloyd:</b> Then again, people ARE different. Psyches are fractal in their variety, and in their immensity.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[22:59:58] lloyd:</b> He could have said: how was I to know she was going to react quite like that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:00:06] lloyd:</b> And he'd have been right to ask that question.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:00:30] lloyd:</b> Tellingly, I remembered something else that had happened years ago, when he was barely conscious, in the manner of adults. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:00:43] lloyd:</b> Why it occurred to me is always going to be a mystery, but such are the workings of memory.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:01:09] lloyd:</b> &quot;Look, it was a disaster. Why didn't we just accept it at that, and move on?&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:02:01] lloyd:</b> But no, we chose to get stuck in a stupid cycle with no way to see clear forward... as if we found ourselves at the end of a long and winding alley, and it was a dead end.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:02:11] lloyd:</b> When she heard of that, it all became clear.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:02:32] lloyd:</b> Stunningly, it made her go silent. Like a light paradoxically turned on, and yet no clarity was forthcoming.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:02:52] lloyd:</b> Or maybe all that meant was that she was unwilling to share exactly what was in her heart at that moment.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:03:09] lloyd:</b> A silence of which she was, of course, entitled.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:03:20] lloyd:</b> In the end, there was nothing else to say. They either had to move on, or drown.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[23:03:35] lloyd:</b> Shortly after, she chose to gave birth. </li>
