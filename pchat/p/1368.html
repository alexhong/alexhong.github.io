	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:21:10] Kass:</b> Ah. Well that's better than the reality, certainly. It's admittedly a bit too much trouble to coddle every troubled person when they come in.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:21:23] Kass:</b> So ignoring them would be sufficient, since at least then you don't make it worse.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:21:33] Kass:</b> (unless in the act of ignoring them, you do, but i digress.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:22:04] Kass:</b> At any rate, as much as we would all like everyone in the world to be perfectly clear about what they want or don't want...</li>
	<li><b>[01:22:06] aqhong:</b> Well, if he clearly <i>wanted</i> attention, that's another matter.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:22:23] Kass:</b> There's much to be said for developing the ability to understand what people don't say. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:22:31] Max:</b> That /away message was pretty provocative if you ask me</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:23:00] Kass:</b> Then why do you rise to the occasion?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:23:04] Kass:</b> Or, maybe in this case, stoop to it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:23:17] Max:</b> Because he's expecting a response, so I have to give one?</li>
	<li><b>[01:23:48] aqhong:</b> Well, I was just pointing out the fact that half the time, his away messages don't make any sense to me. And also the fact that I find them kind of funny.</li>
	<li><b>[01:23:55] aqhong:</b> I dunno. Maybe I shouldn't've?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:24:03] Kass:</b> Um...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:24:11] Kass:</b> I think there are better ways to express that you find them funny. &gt;_&lt;</li>
	<li class="presence">[01:24:14] Spark joined.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[01:24:17] Spark:</b> <a href="http://spark.is-a-geek.net/deleteme/fastmaces.png">fastmaces.png</a></li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:24:18] Kass:</b> Than to call them &quot;irrelevant&quot;.</li>
	<li><b>[01:24:18] aqhong:</b> Probably.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:26:00] Kass:</b> Anyway. We call that being &quot;baited&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:26:13] Kass:</b> And generally, if you're being baited, or provoked or whatever, to do something...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:26:20] Kass:</b> ... It's probably a bad idea to actually do it.</li>
	<li><b>[01:26:22] aqhong:</b> You know... I just realized... I probably don't think through the things I say here as much as I should, because I expect there to be a certain level of... what should I call it. Noise tolerance?</li>
	<li><b>[01:26:24] aqhong:</b> I dunno.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:26:55] Kass:</b> Technically... that would be a good thing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:26:59] Kass:</b> It means you're comfortable here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:27:08] Kass:</b> And that you have a level of trust with other members.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:27:16] Kass:</b> In that... you trust that they won't misconstrue what you have to say.</li>
	<li><b>[01:27:17] aqhong:</b> It's just that my comfort is making other people uncomfortable? ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:27:42] Kass:</b> Well, you merely don't actually have that trust with everyone else here, so that causes issues.</li>
	<li><b>[01:27:54] aqhong:</b> Makes sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:28:17] Kass:</b> I mean, I get pissed at things you say sometimes, but eventually I get over it. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:29:09] Kass:</b> But... yeah. Tansen, as Quad pointed out, is not necessarily a &quot;core&quot; chatter... if you want to call it that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:29:43] Kass:</b> And for whatever reason, he doesn't share the same level of trust as some of the rest of us.</li>
	<li><b>[01:29:53] aqhong:</b> But really, most of the time, I just say the first thing that comes to mind.</li>
	<li><b>[01:29:59] aqhong:</b> And I know that has the potential to cause problems.</li>
	<li><b>[01:30:10] aqhong:</b> It's just that it hasn't caused enough problems that I would consider changing that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:30:28] Max:</b> Or large enough problems to be noticeable</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:30:35] Kass:</b> I think ... it's not something you so much as have to actively change.</li>
	<li><b>[01:30:37] aqhong:</b> Something like that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:30:48] Kass:</b> We don't want you to actually become more cautious with things you say.</li>
	<li><b>[01:31:00] aqhong:</b> Well, more sensitivity is nice?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:06] Kass:</b> The idea is... you and Max and maybe some others should develop the skills to see red flags when they come up.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:26] Kass:</b> And when you actually see those warnings, then you can start thinking about backing off in certain situations.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:34] Kass:</b> As you say, in most cases, there really isn't a problem.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:41] Kass:</b> If there's no problem, then there's no reason to curb your behavior.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:32:25] Kass:</b> Obviously this isn't just like... a lightswitch in your brain that you can flick and start working.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:32:34] Kass:</b> No Sylars here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:33:32] Kass:</b> But if you took away anything from this conversation, it'd be that I think it would help prevent situations in the future if you just try to start recognizing these signs.</li>
	<li><b>[01:33:56] aqhong:</b> Right.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:34:16] Kass:</b> ... And if you're confused, you can always ask.</li>
	<li class="status">[01:34:36] aqhong went away: BRB.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:34:37] Max:</b> Our problem will be, if we get caught in such a situation, we won't necessarily be able to back out of it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:34:44] Max:</b> Or at least I won't, probably</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:35:46] Kass:</b> Ideally, you'll just see the warning signs before you get into an intractable situations.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:36:41] Kass:</b> If not, best policy is to just stop talking -- or sometimes just start apologizing profusely. And after it's all blown over, you can go back over the conversation and see if there were any warnings that you could have picked up on.</li>
	<li class="status">[01:37:10] aqhong returned.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:37:17] Max:</b> See, that's part of it. Pride will keep me from apologizing. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:37:44] Kass:</b> Do you think that's a good trait?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:37:48] Kass:</b> Is that how you like it?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:37:53] Max:</b> No, but it's something I have. I won't deny it.</li>
	<li><b>[01:37:58] aqhong:</b> It's a pretty human trait, if you ask me ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:38:07] Kass:</b> It is that.</li>
	<li><b>[01:38:27] aqhong:</b> Or maybe I'm just being cynical. Could be that too :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:38:34] Kass:</b> But you have to admit that a vast majority of human traits are ones we would probably be better off without.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:38:41] Max:</b> Don't you feel like you can't back out without having the last word? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:39:02] Kass:</b> Sure. But I also know that having the last word doesn't automatically make you right.</li>
	<li><b>[01:39:05] aqhong:</b> Yes, we could do without a lot of human traits ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:39:39] Kass:</b> Let's take Quad, for example.</li>
	<li><b>[01:39:41] aqhong:</b> It doesn't make you right, but you don't have to be right to feel good ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:05] Kass:</b> I think it's a somewhat humiliating situation that he's in with Seppuku.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:13] Kass:</b> Having to buy him off to prevent attacks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:21] Kass:</b> Why not just suck it up, be prideful, and take the catapults.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:41:06] Kass:</b> He pays cause he just wants to avoid conflict and survive.</li>
	<li><b>[01:41:32] aqhong:</b> You know... if I were in his situation, I'd probably just abandon that account and re-roll. Because I really don't think I could put up with that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:41:33] Kass:</b> Of course... I suppose, in a way, Quad is getting the so-called &quot;last word&quot;... by undercutting him.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:41:37] Max:</b> Sure, but they're not exactly on an even footing here</li>
	<li><b>[01:41:55] aqhong:</b> Guess I just have too much pride :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:42:09] Kass:</b> ::lol:: Quad has a great deal of pride.</li>
	<li><b>[01:42:19] aqhong:</b> I have more? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:42:24] Kass:</b> Just that... Quad has a great deal of sensibility to balance it. :P</li>
	<li><b>[01:42:29] aqhong:</b> Oh, there :)</li>
	<li><b>[01:42:34] aqhong:</b> No sensibility here! :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:42:45] Kass:</b> Right, well, that's a personal choice... or something.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:43:02] Kass:</b> I'm not altogether sure if I would continue with an account with that kind of threat looming over me all the time either, to be honest.</li>
	<li><b>[01:43:17] aqhong:</b> Max? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:43:24] Max:</b> I rerolled, remember? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:43:24] Kass:</b> But Quad's proud of his village and he's invested a great deal of effort into it. And I can certainly see how it'd be a PITA to start over.</li>

	<li><b>[01:43:27] aqhong:</b> Oh, right.</li>

	<li><b>[01:43:42] aqhong:</b> Well, wait. Your situation wasn't the same...</li>
