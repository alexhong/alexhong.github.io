	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:07:53] lloyd:</b> But still... Hillary has been fighting tooth and nail, and if she gets both the popular vote lead in TX and OH tomorrow, she's definitely going to play on.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:13] lloyd:</b> Obama should be focusing his sights (and spending his money) on McCain now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:35] lloyd:</b> I was optimistic about Obama winning TX, until a few days ago.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:58] lloyd:</b> It's going to be chaotic there tomorrow... and I'm not sure that's an entirely good thing for Obama.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:11:11] lloyd:</b> And they're probably going to try the same crap in the TX caucuses.</li>

	<li><b>[01:11:32] aqhong:</b> Wasn't reported at all in the media :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:13:55] lloyd:</b> It's going to be close across the board tomorrow... which should be seen as a win for Obama, obviously. But that's not going to happen. The Clintons are going to spin that mightily as a victory for HRC.</li>

	<li><b>[01:19:57] aqhong:</b> I wouldn't give her much credit for doing the &quot;right thing.&quot; She's been pretty good at avoiding that :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:20:21] Max:</b> Her compass definitely doesn't point north :O</li>
	<li><b>[01:22:16] aqhong:</b> There's no realistic way she can even up the delegate count at this point. Which means her only possibility for the nomination is to steal it. And if she doesn't drop out tomorrow, I will assume that's her plan.</li>
