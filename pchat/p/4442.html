	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:02:18] Kass:</b> And what do you think you've learned as far as those two things are concerned?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:02:35] lloyd:</b> Quite a bit, I must say.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:03:49] lloyd:</b> And as I put it to Quad this morning in chat, it wasn't very encouraging.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:04:15] Kass:</b> I'm not really sure what it is exactly that you took offense to.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:04:18] lloyd:</b> Sounded dismissive, almost. But maybe I was being a bit defensive, I dunno.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:04:25] Forward Biased:</b> it feels like you're being awfully defensive, Lloyd</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:04:39] Forward Biased:</b> man, one scoop of oatmeal made me late on that comment =/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:05:08] Kass:</b> Generally it feels to me that you have become a lot more ruthless and competitive and other niggling things that I think are detrimental gaming habits.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:05:21] Kass:</b> But I mean, that's only the stuff I hear about in here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:05:33] Kass:</b> Maybe you've picked up on a lot of really good things and you just never voice any of it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:05:40] lloyd:</b> And you think there's nothing positive I'm gaining from all this?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:06:01] Kass:</b> If there is, you're just not vocal about it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:06:15] Kass:</b> You keep saying you're learning positive things, but I've yet to see concrete examples. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:06:25] Kass:</b> Other than your friendship with Neil.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:06:42] Kass:</b> Then again, that's normal.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:06:47] Kass:</b> That people only hear the bad things that happen.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:07:12] lloyd:</b> You don't think being competitive, or learning to be competitive, isn't a positive thing, actually?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:07:36] Kass:</b> Competitiveness is a very strange trait.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:07:45] lloyd:</b> And I admit it, Quad. I'm a bit defensive about it. But look at it this way: I'm fairly new at online gaming, and I look up to all of you for your experience/prowess. So, when it feels like what I'm doing is somehow... off, or tainted... then it feels raw.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:07:45] Kass:</b> There are definitely arenas in which it can be a healthy mindset.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:07:52] Kass:</b> In others, it's terribly poisonous.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:07:58] Kass:</b> IMO, anyway.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:08:20] lloyd:</b> Is it poisonous in Travian, you think? Is there a possibility of that happening here?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:08:48] Forward Biased:</b> I don't think there's much competition going on among ourselves in Travian because the rankings are pretty much set by now</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:08:50] Kass:</b> Well, it's pretty mild here. All you're doing is competing to be the highest pop or whatever, so you show up at the top in the embassy listing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:09:28] lloyd:</b> Hm... there seems to me to be a lot more areas of friendly competition in Travian, other than just pop count.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:09:58] Kass:</b> This is a poor example, but ... if you wanted my honest opinion, I think Chungster's deleting because he's not top of the alliance anymore.</li>
	<li><b>[02:10:12] aqhong:</b> Er... he hasn't been at the top for a while.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:10:13] lloyd:</b> He hasn't been, for a while? I</li>
	<li><b>[02:10:20] aqhong:</b> He was only there for maybe a few days.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:10:30] Kass:</b> He's not even second anymore.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:10:43] Forward Biased:</b> personally, I think it's busy-ness + monotony</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:10:43] lloyd:</b> orly ::looks::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#66B814">[02:10:45] Janvi:</b> Uhh.. yeah... I think he's definitely deleting because of schoolwork</li>
	<li><b>[02:10:54] aqhong:</b> Yeah, I don't think pop has anything to do with it XD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:10:55] Forward Biased:</b> honestly not that much exciting going on in Travian now ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:10:55] Kass:</b> Ah. Okay. ::shrug:: My mistake then.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:10:56] Max:</b> I think it's because he's not in the Green Zone</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:11:38] Forward Biased:</b> is it time to make a Travian exit plan?</li>
	<li><b>[02:11:42] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:11:48] Max:</b> How about... a war with ourselves :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:11:49] Kass:</b> Anyway. I don't really think competitiveness in Travian is all that productive. It's not &quot;poisonous&quot; either, but it doesn't encourage improvement in any way either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:11:54] lloyd:</b> You've talked about that already, Quad, haven't you?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:12:26] Forward Biased:</b> I've talked about needing one. Wasn't sure exactly how it would play out.</li>
	<li><b>[02:12:36] aqhong:</b> Let</li>
	<li><b>[02:12:40] aqhong:</b> Let's all attack each other :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:12:44] lloyd:</b> lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:12:52] Kass:</b> I can tell you... competition in WoW can be absolutely poisonous. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:12:55] Max:</b> Form two Alliance and start fighting :O</li>
	<li><b>[02:13:01] aqhong:</b> Nah, every man for himself :O</li>

	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:13:26] Forward Biased:</b> I don't consider that fun...</li>
	<li><b>[02:13:31] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:14:02] Kass:</b> ... Are you all bored of Travian? O_o</li>
	<li><b>[02:14:11] aqhong:</b> No?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:14:18] Kass:</b> Then why are you talking about exit plans...? O_o</li>
	<li><b>[02:14:23] aqhong:</b> I'm not :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:14:33] Kass:</b> What is Quad talking about.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:14:33] lloyd:</b> To put it in the most basic perspective, Kass, I've gotten a hell of a lot of pleasure out of playing Travian these past few months. The details almost don't matter... it's highly unusual for me to be so absorbed with a game -- any game -- so, this really is making an impression on me.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:14:34] Forward Biased:</b> because we'll eventually stop playing?</li>
	<li><b>[02:14:49] aqhong:</b> I kinda figured we'd stop playing when the server ends?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#AD1F1F">[02:15:00] Dennis:</b> Most likely</li>
	<li><b>[02:15:09] aqhong:</b> There's the plan? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:15:30] Kass:</b> Right well, that's fine, I guess. If it's fun, then that's really all the reason you need.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[02:15:44] Forward Biased:</b> if we stick it out that long, I'm pretty sure my growth rate will plateau without a way of automating village building...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:16:01] Max:</b> You can turn to conquering :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:16:06] Kass:</b> Maybe that's what I take issue with... is that you seem to try to wrap all these other reasons around why you're interested.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:16:18] Kass:</b> Instead of the one that's actually fundamental.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:16:22] lloyd:</b> You're saying Im making them up? lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#66B814">[02:16:31] Janvi:</b> lol...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:16:34] Kass:</b> No, just that it makes you look defensive, as you and Quad have now both pointed out. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:16:36] lloyd:</b> Of course they're consequences.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:17:11] Kass:</b> It's like Kenton accusing me of being addicted to WoW and me having no way to defend myself without sounding like I'm in denial.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:17:30] lloyd:</b> Yes, I admit that. Because, like I said, when I've put in so much into it... and here you come saying that you don't think I've gained anything positive out of it... well... you write the conclusion.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:18:02] Kass:</b> Well all you have to say is that &quot;it's fun&quot; and then I'll just shut up. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:18:05] Kass:</b> Not really a big deal.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#66B814">[02:18:25] Janvi:</b> To me, it's a game I can play without having to necessarily spend a ton of time on it... I dunno if I've really gained anything from Travian except being able to talk to you guys more about... something.</li>
	<li><b>[02:19:18] aqhong:</b> (Travianites Anonymous in session? :O)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#66B814">[02:19:25] Janvi:</b> lol -_-</li>
