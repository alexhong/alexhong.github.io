	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:24] Kass:</b> Ooh, ooh. I had an awesome jackass / not-jackass story, but it's about WoW and I don't know that people will get it. :(</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:29:26] lloyd:</b> Oo. Iron 10 done. Can build foundry now.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:52] Kass:</b> So in WoW, there are like... herbs and mines everywhere.</li>
	<li><b>[02:29:53] aqhong:</b> Does this involve ganking? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:29:59] Kass:</b> Sort of.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:30:00] Max:</b> Did you kill someone mining?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:09] Kass:</b> So if you're an herbalist or a miner, you can get those items.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:23] Kass:</b> But a lot of the time, they'll be guarded by one monster who's just nearby and will attack you if you try to pick the item.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:33] Kass:</b> Anyway, so I was in Shadowmoon and I stopped to get a flower.</li>
	<li><b>[02:30:41] aqhong:</b> You're an herbalist? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:42] Kass:</b> Got attacked by a mob and so I started to kill it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:30:45] Kass:</b> My druid is, yeah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:30:50] Max:</b> Someone else picked the flower? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:31:05] Kass:</b> So I'm slowly killing it, cause I'm restoration specced and I kill at about 0.000000002 HP/hour.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:31:35] Kass:</b> And some jerkwad alliance swoops down on their epic flying mount, loots the flower while I am standing on it (clearly interested, but I'm busy killing something and can't)</li>
	<li><b>[02:31:44] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:04] Kass:</b> Not ONLY that... s/he blows a kiss at me and says something like... BE LUCKY I CULD BE HORDE AND KILLU</li>
	<li><b>[02:32:12] aqhong:</b> Nice.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:32:25] lloyd:</b> Epic. And then?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:31] Kass:</b> And it's like, WHILE s/he was picking it, I said &quot;...&quot; while fighting... and &quot;You've got to be kidding me.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:46] Kass:</b> At any rate. That was my sob story. I really, REALLY hate people like that, cause it's such an asshole thing to do.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:32:52] Kass:</b> So I told this story in guild chat.</li>
	<li><b>[02:32:57] aqhong:</b> Moral of story: Don't be that guy :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:33:02] Kass:</b> And someone responded with his own, really kickass story.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:33:14] Kass:</b> He was out mining and was killing a mob, while standing over a mine.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:33:34] Max:</b> Oh, but more than one person can get a mine at a time....</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:33:36] Kass:</b> This horde character flies by, also looking for mines... but he actually sees Joaradan on the mine and he starts to go away, leaving him to it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:01] Kass:</b> Nearly at the same time, an ALLIANCE paladin comes and is not so courteous and starts to hit the mine.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:15] Kass:</b> And the horde turns back around, gets off and kills the paladin in 2-shots.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:34:21] Max:</b> Nice XD</li>
	<li><b>[02:34:24] aqhong:</b> Knight in shining armor :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:40] Kass:</b> And Joaradan was like... omg, so awesome. /hugged him and was able to take the mine.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:34:56] Kass:</b> When the paladin came back, he tried to get Joaradan to help him KILL the horde.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:35:15] Kass:</b> And Joaradan was like, okay. And then the paladin rezzes and the horde kills him again, while Joaradan /dances with the horde. XP</li>
	<li><b>[02:35:26] aqhong:</b> Hahaha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:35:32] Kass:</b> Then Joaradan had to block the paladin from sending him messages, cause the guy started cussing him out. :x</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:36:15] Kass:</b> And now after hearing that story, I am a Daevohk fangirl, cause not only was he nice enough to let someone have the mine they discovered... he defended their right to it. ^_^;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:37:06] Max:</b> Haha, that sounds like the time Chris and I were in Nagrand and Chris was basically just killing the other alliance members trying to farm my primal waters </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:37:42] Kass:</b> You know the fishing tournament in Stranglethorn?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:37:47] lloyd:</b> Tangential aside...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:37:50] Kass:</b> I did that for several weeks, trying to win.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:37:53] Max:</b> Not really, I've never participated in it</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:38:01] lloyd:</b> ...why is Quad not interested in WoW, and Spark not interested in Travian? ::chckle::</li>
	<li><b>[02:38:09] aqhong:</b> Better ask them ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:38:22] Kass:</b> Not only did we have alliance coming to gank the horde that were fishing... a couple of my alliance friends would go pester other alliance fishers, by jumping up and down on their bobbers.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:38:35] lloyd:</b> Maybe Kass would know since she's (a) intimately familiar with both and (b) plays both games. ;p</li>
	<li><b>[02:38:36] aqhong:</b> From what I've gathered: Quad doesn't like grinding, Spark doesn't like slow games :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:38:51] Max:</b> Grinding is a slow game :/</li>
	<li><b>[02:38:57] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:39:12] Kass:</b> I think there's a little more instant gratification with WoW than there is with Travian.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:39:28] Kass:</b> That's a really poor way of putting it... but I have no idea how else to describe it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:39:46] Kass:</b> WoW just feels more involved.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:39:54] lloyd:</b> Well, Quad plays lots of games that provide instant gratification, doesn't he?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:10] Kass:</b> Well, here's the thing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:16] Kass:</b> We don't actually know that Quad would not like WoW.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:33] Kass:</b> He has (intelligently?) stayed away from ever playing it because he reasons he has no need to.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:42] Kass:</b> Since he doesn't have thaaat many friends who are playing it...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:47] Kass:</b> So the social aspect doesn't draw him...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:40:54] Kass:</b> And he has plenty of other games he's interested in, so he's not looking for something new.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:41:17] Kass:</b> None of that indicates that he actually would dislike the game if he tried it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:41:36] Kass:</b> The only thing that might give an actual reason for him disliking it is that Bigi eventually grew tired of it and stopped playing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:41:54] Kass:</b> So if their tastes are similar enough, Quad could probably reason that he won't enjoy it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:42:02] lloyd:</b> Doubtless, Quad would be quite good at it, yes?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:42:16] Kass:</b> Believe it or not, it is not difficult to be good at WoW. -_-</li>
	<li><b>[02:42:22] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[02:42:35] Max:</b> Invest enough time in it is all you need to do :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:42:45] Kass:</b> PvP is more challenging, but even then...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:43:16] Kass:</b> I am quite certain that Quad would be an intelligent and aware player, which is all you need to be good at PvE.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:43:46] Kass:</b> He probably also has the requisite twitch-reaction/coordination for PvP.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:45:04] Kass:</b> Though truth be told, I could potentially see Quad growing bored with playing WoW, since unless you get into the PvP aspect, there's not much depth... that is, it doesn't require developing greater skill as you advance.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:46:07] Kass:</b> What there IS a lot of is memorization... learning and exploring and getting a sense of new enemies and how they have to be handled and what bosses do what and how to counter, etc.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:46:47] Kass:</b> Of course, it's effortless memorization, but meh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:46:57] lloyd:</b> Why does Alex Hong not do WoW?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:47:57] Kass:</b> Alex Hong's not a gamer.</li>
	<li><b>[02:48:04] aqhong:</b> Ding ding ding! :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:48:25] Kass:</b> I am ever perceptive.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:48:35] lloyd:</b> Well, he could have fooled me. ;-)</li>
	<li><b>[02:48:48] aqhong:</b> Not perceptive enough? ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:49:03] Kass:</b> I bet Alex can't name more than ten games he's played.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[02:49:03] lloyd:</b> As far as gaming goes? Not nearly.</li>
	<li><b>[02:49:11] aqhong:</b> Whoa, whoa.</li>
	<li><b>[02:49:14] aqhong:</b> I bet I can.</li>
	<li><b>[02:49:23] aqhong:</b> You wanna revise that? :O</li>
