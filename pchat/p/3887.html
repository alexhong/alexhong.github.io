	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:39:09] Kass:</b> The fact that Mark straight out said that Ian was completely unprepared and did not &quot;go the distance&quot; on it did not really bode well.</li>
	<li><b>[22:39:10] aqhong:</b> He was so focused on the mod thing that he didn't get around to writing a paper. Unless you're saying he didn't write a paper on purpose?</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:41:10] Kass:</b> He may have misjudged how hard it would be to do a mod, but it would have been because he couldn't get something foundational to work.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:41:19] Spark:</b> to sort of butt into this convo, I would really have to agree with the reaction shown by his profs-</li>

	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:41:39] Spark:</b> and it sounds like he totally failed in that regard</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:41:50] Kass:</b> He is NOT a novice programmer and any problem he ran into would have to be something he encountered early, which required learning more information than could be attained just by reading online.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:44:27] Spark:</b> this is absolutely 100% consistent with that message, isn't it?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:44:50] Spark:</b> he's pretty courageous to follow through though XD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:44:53] Kass:</b> Um. I don't think so. He's the one who wanted more feedback, more critiques on presentations, etc.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:45:10] Kass:</b> Oh, well, in that respect.</li>
	<li><b>[22:45:11] aqhong:</b> He said he wanted more of the actual &quot;doing the stuff,&quot; right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:45:22] Spark:</b> wasn't his main point that he didn't want to write up projects that weren't going to ever see the light of day?</li>

	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:45:31] Spark:</b> and so he went right ahead and did something that would happen right away</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B9191">[22:45:45] Spark:</b> and totally ignored the whole paper which would have simply described what &quot;might be&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:46:37] Kass:</b> I guess. It was supposed to be an exercise in project proposing, since you're supposed to analyze budget costs and crap like that.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[22:47:10] Kass:</b> Regardless, this whole rant started out because I think there's something fundamentally wrong with not doing something because you don't think you can do a good job on it.</li>
