	<li><b>[00:33:10] aqhong:</b> Can't say it's anyone's fault either... just not really sure what got him so pissed off in the first place, more like.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:37:50] Kass:</b> I think that's absolutely one of the most terrible things about this chatroom.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:38:16] Kass:</b> But instead, even you think it's not a good place to be if your skin isn't tough.</li>
	<li><b>[00:38:58] aqhong:</b> Well, obviously. I wouldn't act the way I do if I didn't think I could stand someone else acting the same way.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:42:20] Kass:</b> Yeah, but there are people who aren't doing just fine. Should they be told to toughen up or get out?</li>
