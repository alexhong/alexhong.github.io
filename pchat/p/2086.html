	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:31:30] Max:</b> I can't believe you guys have time to drink. Sheesh</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:31:57] Kass:</b> We don't have time to drink unless NO ONE is paying attention to us.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:32:08] Kass:</b> And it's only when no one's taking heavy damage.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:32:14] Kass:</b> Which only happens in 2s and 3s maybe.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:32:29] lloyd:</b> There's a simple reason why this blatantly propandistic site of Clinton's hasn't gained more traction in the media...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:32:43] Kass:</b> Most teams are smart enough to at least put a pet on druids so that they can't ever get out of combat, even if players aren't whacking them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:33:30] Max:</b> As a healer, what do you think of the Flametongue totem buff....</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:34:09] lloyd:</b> ...and it's that it's *transparently* dishonest. Journalists and media/political analysts can see right through it, hence aren't giving it any time, or any play. The Clinton campaign can spin this every which way until Sunday, but no one's going to pay attention.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:34:28] Kass:</b> I think it's retarded? :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:34:34] lloyd:</b> That, too.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:34:50] lloyd:</b> It made sense. ;-)</li>
	<li><b>[01:34:54] aqhong:</b> True dat :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:35:06] lloyd:</b> One good thing I've come to conclude about the superdelegates is that there's no way they're going to let Hillary steal the election. Their own jobs are on the line.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:35:40] Max:</b> I find it frustrating that we'd get hit by another nerf bat for such a complaint when no one listens to our complaints :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:35:47] lloyd:</b> Evidence #1: John Lewis! haha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:36:08] Kass:</b> Aida, what do you know about the superdelegates?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#6B824A">[01:36:11] AIDA:</b> Don't know much, but I do know the superdelegates is that there's no way they're going to let Hillary steal the election.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:36:18] lloyd:</b> Awesome, Aida. heheh</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:36:51] Kass:</b> I've been thinking that I'll probably retire her during the summer and rework Voices while we're doing TIC. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[01:36:55] aqhong:</b> I know that <i>they</i> can see right through it, but why aren't they calling attention to the fact that she's basically saying she's willing to subvert the popular vote? It seems like an utterly indefensible position.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:37:07] lloyd:</b> Lewis was (and is) a very close personal friend of the Clinton's. Even so, he switched. That says something.</li>
	<li><b>[01:37:11] aqhong:</b> Especially after all the 2000 election crap.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:37:41] lloyd:</b> That's a good question...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:38:27] lloyd:</b> ...at this point, it's probably slightly premature in the sense that March 4 indeed needs to happen first. </li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:38:47] lloyd:</b> After March 4, when the numbers become finally clear and irrevocable... IF she continues this crap, then I'm sure she'll be called on it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:39:31] lloyd:</b> Which is why... LET's ... GET ... ON ... THE ... PHONES ... THIS ... WEEKEND. (Use your free minutes!) Can't take it for granted, really.</li>
	<li><b>[01:40:44] aqhong:</b> I don't see how it can be premature... what difference does it make when she's called out on it? If anything, shouldn't they get to it sooner, since voters could easily be driven away from Clinton when they find out about this BS?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:41:53] lloyd:</b> Another good question. I think it has to do with the psychology of journalists and politics...</li>
	<li><b>[01:42:21] aqhong:</b> Bleh. Well, I can't say I'll ever understand journalism...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:42:50] lloyd:</b> ...even though they really shouldn't insert themselves into the actual politics, journalists do it all the time, in how they frame any bit of political news. By focusing on this egregious bit, it might seem to the general public like a kind of piling on, against Clinton. Remember after Iowa, and before New Hampshire? In that way.</li>
	<li><b>[01:42:53] aqhong:</b> All I know is her position as stated on that page is fundamentally disrespectful towards the voting public as a whole. Including her own supporters.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:43:03] lloyd:</b> The response of the electorate was clear. They gave Hillary the win in NH.</li>
	<li><b>[01:43:30] aqhong:</b> I guess that's true...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:43:43] lloyd:</b> I think a majority of journalists want to see an Obama White House. Hence, they don't want to be played by the Clinton campaign. Focusing on this tactic of Hillary's gives her traction, in a sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:44:12] lloyd:</b> Their play is to stop Obama's momentum at all costs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:44:23] lloyd:</b> This website is a pretty obvious tactic towards that.</li>
	<li><b>[01:44:38] aqhong:</b> But as you said, in this case, they can see right through it, it's so transparent. They don't have to spin much to get people to realize how retarded that is.</li>
	<li><b>[01:44:40] aqhong:</b> But whatever.</li>
	<li><b>[01:45:16] aqhong:</b> And yeah, I was reading about the media bias towards Obama earlier...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:45:50] lloyd:</b> Interesting. Very, very few hits for &quot;The Delegate Hub,&quot; (with or without quotes) in news.google.com</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:46:02] lloyd:</b> It's basically being ignored. lol</li>
	<li><b>[01:46:22] aqhong:</b> Meh, maybe it's the right thing to do. I dunno, I haven't thought it through that much.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:47:14] lloyd:</b> It's pretty straightforward, I think. Focusing on it will create buzz for Hillary. The fact that it's negative buzz is irrelevant to the HRC campaign at this point, as they want to BE the news. To control the news cycle.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:47:39] lloyd:</b> The more they're in the news, the less that Obama's stuff will be in there. It's a zero sum game, really. Odd as that may seem. But that's how the media works.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:48:10] Kass:</b> ... What's Lloyd know about zero sum?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:48:19] lloyd:</b> This dynamic explains why Rovean tactics are so effective.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:48:49] Max:</b> Zero sum means one person loses as much as the other gains</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:48:58] lloyd:</b> K: other than the idiomatic meaning? Nothing else. Is the mathematical or physical meaning different?</li>
	<li><b>[01:49:25] aqhong:</b> By the way, I found an analog (kinda) to the quote you posted on your weblog today, Lloyd ;)</li>
	<li><b>[01:49:30] aqhong:</b> Obama in 2004: &quot;&quot;I can unequivocally say I will not be running for national office in four years.&quot;</li>
	<li><b>[01:49:33] aqhong:</b> Pwned :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:49:52] Max:</b> Technically, airtime is zero-sum.... but they do have weights attached to them</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:49:53] lloyd:</b> lol</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:50:11] lloyd:</b> 4 years is a lifetime ago in politics.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:50:36] lloyd:</b> 2006 happened, for one thing. That'll change anyone's mind. ;-)</li>

	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:52:18] Max:</b> Filled with memories I don't look back at with Youtube every so often :O</li>

	<li><b>[01:52:50] aqhong:</b> That's kind of a funny thing to say, then... he wasn't even planning to run for reelection to the Senate?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:53:04] lloyd:</b> Yeah. That's kinda odd.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:53:21] lloyd:</b> The difference between the Obama quote and Hillary's is her sheer arrogance.</li>

	<li><b>[01:54:36] aqhong:</b> Man, I remember watching that Colbert thing for the first time and thinking &quot;holy shit, he has balls.&quot;</li>
