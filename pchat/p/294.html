	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:00:30] lloyd:</b> Well, I've been having a not-so-hypothetical discussion with a certain person your age (or a little older)...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:00:46] lloyd:</b> ...about a draft, and what if it happened. And what if one got selected.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:00:58] lloyd:</b> It has been intense and enlightening.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:01:01] lloyd:</b> But now, I want to ask him this:</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:01:31] lloyd:</b> &quot;Do you believe that your government, as presently constituted, can be tyrannical?&quot; </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:03:27] Kass:</b> &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[00:03:34] aqhong:</b> &lt;_&lt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:03:44] Kass:</b> You want us to what? Answer?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:03:49] lloyd:</b> Oh yes.</li>
	<li><b>[00:04:04] aqhong:</b> &quot;Not sure.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:05:05] Kass:</b> I don't think our answers would please you, Lloyd.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:05:16] lloyd:</b> It's not a matter of being pleased or displeased, Kass.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:05:30] lloyd:</b> I'm genuinely curious as to how you think (or not think) about this particular idea.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:06:06] Kass:</b> Speaking for myself, but I'd guess that this is how a few others feel too... we're generally much to uninformed to hold an educated opinion on the matter.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:06:13] Kass:</b> much too uninformed, even</li>
	<li><b>[00:06:24] aqhong:</b> Unfortunately :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:06:43] lloyd:</b> I actually don't think it's mostly a matter of &quot;being informed.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:07:09] lloyd:</b> One can be totally informed, and yet not believe that a tyrannical state is possible. Wearing ideological blinders, as it were.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:07:28] lloyd:</b> I'm aware that it's an unfair question, from the start.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:07:29] Kass:</b> I'm saying we don't have any information, so we can't make a decision on whether it is or it isn't.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:07:38] Kass:</b> Not that we think it isn't because we don't have enough information.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:08:34] lloyd:</b> But surely you can have an opinion on whether it is hypothetically possible for the United States of America to be a tyranny or not. I think most people would say it is constitutionally impossible.</li>
	<li><b>[00:08:51] aqhong:</b> What exactly is &quot;tyranny&quot; again? :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:09:25] lloyd:</b> When a state oppresses its people, to further the ends of an elite, or those in power.</li>
	<li><b>[00:09:51] aqhong:</b> By that definition... of course.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:10:10] Max Santana:</b> Well then, by that definition I think any non-pure-communist government is a tyranny. :/</li>
	<li><b>[00:10:11] aqhong:</b> The question is, how much oppression is enough oppression to be considered tyranny?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:10:37] lloyd:</b> Good thinking, Alex.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:10:38] Forward Biased:</b> as much as goes on now, I'd say ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:10:48] Forward Biased:</b> there's a lot of power concentrated in a small number of people</li>
	<li><b>[00:10:51] aqhong:</b> Then it's already tyranny :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:11:03] lloyd:</b> Again, for most Americans these days, it probably comes down to: &quot;when it affects ME.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:11:21] lloyd:</b> So the question becomes exactly how is that manifested or demonstrated.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:11:24] Forward Biased:</b> DRM. Affecting you every day.</li>
	<li><b>[00:11:28] aqhong:</b> But how much? I'm sure it affects pretty much every one.</li>
	<li><b>[00:11:35] aqhong:</b> everyone*</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:11:50] lloyd:</b> I think you'll know it when you see it.</li>
	<li><b>[00:11:51] aqhong:</b> Just sometimes in ways so minor that you get used to them and stop noticing.</li>
	<li><b>[00:12:18] aqhong:</b> Well... not minor, necessarily. But you get used to them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:12:47] Max Santana:</b> Some examples are miniscule, but affect a ton of people. Yet no one cares enough to vote against it while those who benefit get enough to care to vote for it, even if there's only about three of them.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:13:41] lloyd:</b> Here's a plain fact: I for one am going to be utterly adamant and vocal against the policies of this current administration. What if it gets me in real trouble and I get arrested for my beliefs/pronouncements/actions? Would that then constitute, for you, a &quot;tyrannical act&quot; by the government?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:15:32] Kass:</b> Of course?</li>
	<li><b>[00:15:33] aqhong:</b> If it was only you? What about other people also in your position?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:15:51] lloyd:</b> brb phone Trev</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:16:05] Max Santana:</b> This example would probably be so extreme that there would be little contradictions in our answers. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:17:39] lloyd:</b> back.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:17:44] lloyd:</b> &quot;Only</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:17:52] lloyd:</b> Only me? ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:18:24] Kass:</b> I think what Alex means is that we'd think it was tyrannical for ANYone to get arrested for stating their beliefs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:18:24] lloyd:</b> I can guarantee you Alex, it won't be only me. </li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:18:35] Kass:</b> Not that we would think it's tyrannical just because it was YOU that was arrested.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:18:45] lloyd:</b> Well, I wanted to use myself as an example, because I'm who you know.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:18:45] Kass:</b> It's not our personal attachment to you that would upset us, in other words.</li>
	<li><b>[00:18:47] aqhong:</b> Yeah...</li>
	<li><b>[00:18:58] aqhong:</b> But the fact that we know you clouds our judgment ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:20:15] lloyd:</b> That's good, Kass. That certainly doesn't displease me. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:20:24] Kass:</b> That's not what I thought would displease you.</li>
	<li><b>[00:20:30] aqhong:</b> XD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:21:23] lloyd:</b> Here's the thing, though... I don't really want to go into a whole political discussion right now, but here's what I believe: the government has already displayed tyrannical behavior, in the past few years. There are scores, if not hundreds, of innocent detainees in Guantanamo, a number of them American citizens.</li>
	<li><b>[00:21:38] aqhong:</b> I totally saw that coming :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:21:45] lloyd:</b> How am I sure they're &quot;innocent&quot;?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:22:06] lloyd:</b> Well, for one thing, after so many years they're still languishing there, without charges.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:23:10] lloyd:</b> For another, and more critically, their American lawyers are clear that the American government doesn't have a leg to stand on as far as any compelling charges against these people.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:24:01] lloyd:</b> Most Americans neither know, nor care, about this sobering reality. I'm suggesting that they're about to see something else, with ordinary citizens (or even non-citizens), putting their beliefs on the line.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:32:23] Kass:</b> So what's the conclusion then, Lloyd? &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[00:32:38] aqhong:</b> &quot;We're all screwed&quot;? :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:32:43] lloyd:</b> What conclusion? ::chuckle:: It hasn't even begun. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:32:52] lloyd:</b> Oh no, Alex. Au contraire.</li>
	<li><b>[00:32:57] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:33:05] lloyd:</b> If I believed that, then I wouldn't be preparing to do what I'm going to be doing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:33:11] Max Santana:</b> The conclusion is, support the next world dictator because he'll make things better. :P</li>
	<li><b>[00:33:17] aqhong:</b> -_-</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:33:37] lloyd:</b> Some days I think your generation is the luckiest one alive... and the next instant, think it the unluckiest.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:34:23] lloyd:</b> The fact that this oscillation is so rapid in my mind now tells me that something big is coming. Either that, or I'm totally, utterly, mad.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:35:57] Kass:</b> I suppose I just wrongly assumed that you were soapboxing because you wanted us to come out of this conversation with something.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:37:49] lloyd:</b> Right. Surely you should know that I have learned, by now, that mere didacticism is counter-productive? ;p The last thing I want is to browbeat you with my political beliefs and pronounce them Holy Writ. The first thing I want, is for you to ask questions. I think I've succeeded in a very small way, as far as this somewhat one-sided conversation here tonight. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:39:00] lloyd:</b> Meanwhile, Max's head is way up in the clouds, as far as world dictators and ideal systems. No such thing, boy-o.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:39:04] Kass:</b> If that's how you feel. Alex and Max may have asked questions of you, but I don't really see them going and pursuing their quest for self-enlightenment after this is all done.</li>
	<li><b>[00:39:16] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:39:55] Max Santana:</b> If your head is too close to the earth, you'll miss the things you can only see from the sky. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:39:55] lloyd:</b> Oh really? Then you don't give them much credit for being... I dunno. Political animals? ::chuckle::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:40:09] Kass:</b> The strange nature of intelligent people is that they will always be interested, to some degree, in everything.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:40:15] Max Santana:</b> Meanwhile, I do have trouble seeing some finer details... &gt;.&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[00:40:19] aqhong:</b> You mean <i>party</i> animals. Haha, get it? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:40:22] Kass:</b> When you bring it up, we can be curious and inquisitive.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:40:35] Kass:</b> But when all is said and done, there are other things that catch our attention and hold it better.</li>
	<li><b>[00:40:50] aqhong:</b> Get a magnifying glass, Max ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:40:53] lloyd:</b> &quot;Parties&quot; be damned. A lot of good that's doing these days.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:40:58] Max Santana:</b> A telescope would work better</li>
	<li><b>[00:41:01] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:42:00] Kass:</b> And yet you were still ecstatic, Lloyd, when it looked like Democrats would be taking back all of Congress. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:42:00] lloyd:</b> Oh, I have no quarrel with that, Kass. That's as it should be. I *am* saying, though, that during your lifetime, political concerns will rival those things. Because they will definitely infringe on your private lives.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:42:39] lloyd:</b> I still am. The jury's still out on how the Dems are going to react for the whole of this political year. They can still grow a spine. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:43:04] lloyd:</b> But initial moves have not been sanguine. They're just content to let Bush wallow in his mistake.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[00:44:18] lloyd:</b> Meanwhile, more American young men and women (mostly of the working class persuasion) will die, for this President's horrible mistake. The Dems acquiescing to this, politically sane though it looks, is morally corrupt. Oh right. Even Dem politicians mostly don't have family members in the military. Doh!</li>
	<li class="presence">[01:08:21] lloyd left.</li>
