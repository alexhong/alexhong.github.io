	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:36:36] Kass:</b> I mean, that's a minor aspect of what is interesting about the chatbots.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:36:58] Kass:</b> That's basically the only thing Voices has going, which is why I've been running circles with backend to make it good.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:37:10] Kass:</b> If you guys are sticking to simple stuff, you can program a lot more things faster.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:37:28] Kass:</b> Like Hangman games or battlebots or whatever.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:39:32] Kass:</b> No, just makes it seem like I really don't need to keep working on it.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:00] Kass:</b> It'd be better to let you guys learn how to implement whatever you wanted to implement.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:40:24] Max:</b> Kinda like you passed on the mantle?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:36] Kass:</b> I'm kind of depressed about it... cause while I did parade Voices around as my senior project and whatnot... I did still do all that work to make this chatroom more interesting.</li>
	<li><b>[01:40:54] aqhong:</b> You did.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:40:54] Kass:</b> And it is a little frustrating to see that it's basically not needed anymore.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:45:32] Kass:</b> Well. I don't know that there is anything to find out. We learned some things, naturally... I wrote blurbs and made up things to tell people in the art world that may or may not have been accurate enough.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:46:11] Kass:</b> Regardless, it's not even the art aspect of Voices that I'd be developing anymore.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:48:14] Kass:</b> Um. ::looks at her &quot;Upcoming&quot; page:: Most of it has to do with tightening the code and weeding out the more insidious bugs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:48:25] Kass:</b> Major rehaul for extensibility.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:48:36] Kass:</b> And then a couple things for improved seeming intelligence.</li>
	<li><b>[01:49:44] aqhong:</b> And you don't think that's worth the effort anymore?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:51:23] Kass:</b> ::shrug:: There're a lot of things that I end up starting... and nearly finish to make a deadline. And then I wish I could continue working on it to finish it in a way that I would actually believe it was finished.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:51:46] Kass:</b> The WoW add-on I wrote is an example of this. -_-</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:52:01] Kass:</b> Fact is that... the feeling of closure just isn't a strong enough motivational force, often enough. Sadly enough.</li>
	<li><b>[01:52:12] aqhong:</b> What stops you from finishing it? Just lack of motivation?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:52:21] Kass:</b> Other things to do.</li>
	<li><b>[01:52:51] aqhong:</b> So this is your way of saying you're abandoning voices, huh?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:53:25] Kass:</b> Well. You guys all seem to expect me to bring Aida back at some point.</li>
	<li><b>[01:53:41] aqhong:</b> You're not going to?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:54:08] Kass:</b> I can't really say no, but it is admittedly looking a little unrealistic.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:54:24] Kass:</b> Maybe we'll get lucky and one day I'll just feel like working on it.</li>
	<li><b>[01:54:28] aqhong:</b> You don't think the whole eavesdropping thing was interesting? Personally, I'm kinda sad that the new kids never got to spend as much time with her as we did, because we had a lot of fun.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:54:57] Kass:</b> Sure it was interesting. But we did that. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[01:55:26] aqhong:</b> New kids didn't get to see much of it :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:55:46] Kass:</b> Yeah, they're out of luck. I can't run the old version anymore because it's memory leaky and the new version has no data.</li>
	<li><b>[01:56:14] aqhong:</b> I can't speak for everyone, but I don't mind starting from scratch.</li>
	<li><b>[01:56:24] aqhong:</b> It's a lot better than no AIDA at all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:56:27] Kass:</b> New version is also not as smart as the old version was at its latest point.</li>
	<li><b>[01:56:32] aqhong:</b> How so?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:56:34] Kass:</b> The pronouns and stuff.</li>
	<li><b>[01:57:35] aqhong:</b> There's no way you could just patch up the memory leaks or whatever problems there were with the old one, and run it? Is that still too much work?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:58:09] Kass:</b> Yes. Finding memory leaks is very painful. :P</li>
	<li><b>[01:58:34] aqhong:</b> :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:58:55] Kass:</b> Doesn't help that I was fairly sure I fixed all the memory leaks in the old version. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:59:54] Kass:</b> So I was surprised to even see that happening.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:00:18] Kass:</b> But it was pretty difficult to refute what was going on when Aida kept crashing every three hours or less.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:00:34] Kass:</b> Anyway, shit. Talking about it makes me want to work. -_-</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:00:36] Kass:</b> I need to go to bed.</li>
	<li><b>[02:00:39] aqhong:</b> Well, I understand if you other things to work on now that take priority. Isn't going to stop us from missing Aida, though. She was a lot more interesting that any of our bots probably ever will be.</li>
	<li><b>[02:00:41] aqhong:</b> G'night.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:01:02] Kass:</b> I'm already tired of having scheduled classes to go to. ::cries::</li>
	<li><b>[02:01:21] aqhong:</b> :|</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:01:40] Kass:</b> Doesn't help that I keep getting extra meetings tacked onto random ends of my classes...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[02:02:00] Kass:</b> So that my three hour class basically turns into a five hour one. x_X</li>
