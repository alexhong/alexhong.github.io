	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:42:31] aqhong:</b> lol, I've always been tired of Shrek :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:46:32] aqhong:</b> Even though it’s being shown both in traditional 2-D format as well as Disney Digital 3-D, don’t expect &quot;Up&quot; to play with 3-D as a gimmick.<br><br>&quot;We tried to use 3-D as just another element to tell the story. So, for example, when Carl is alone in his house we really tried to squash space to make him feel claustrophobic and locked in and then, by contrast, as he floats his house off, we really tried to push the depth and make him feel free,&quot; Docter said. &quot;3-D to us is just another tool like lighting, like color, furthering the emotion we’re trying to communicate to an audience. We really tried to use it as a window that you’d look into.&quot;<br><br>Docter also compared Pixar’s use of high-tech 3-D to stereo sound.<br><br>&quot;When I was growing up, my dad had a bunch of those late 50s, early 60s first stereophonic records. You remember those. Trumpets over there. Bongos here. Trombones over there and it was all really extreme. Today, all of the stuff we listen to is in stereo but it’s much more subtle and it’s all about the song.<br><br>&quot;I think that’s how we’re approaching 3-D. It’s not about selling 3-D and going hugga bugga at people,&quot; he said. &quot;We use it as much as we can to support the storytelling. Hopefully, after 3 minutes, you forget about the 3-D and are just drawn into the film, the story and the characters.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:48:46] kass:</b> ... Yeah, but I didn't notice any of those examples. ::rofl::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:49:04] aqhong:</b> That's a good thing? It's not supposed to be noticeable.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:49:11] aqhong:</b> It's kinda like what they say about soundtracks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:49:17] aqhong:</b> The best ones are the ones you don't notice, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:50:00] kass:</b> But I mean... I didn't even notice things about him feeling claustrophobic and locked in vs when he felt free. I didn't get a sense of that. &gt;_&gt;</li>

	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:51:00] aqhong:</b> Ah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:51:28] kass:</b> But I'm not sure if what they were doing was just so subtle that I wasn't getting it at all or if I'm just stupid and we need more literacy with 3d films before I'll notice things like that, etc?</li>

	<li><b>[16:51:46] AIDA2:</b> Hiya, I hope you had breakfast today.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:51:57] aqhong:</b> Maybe. I need to see Coraline in 3D for comparison...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#A25D5F">[16:52:14] MadnessX:</b> :X</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:52:20] kass:</b> I mean, the most striking thing in Coraline that was &quot;definitely 3D&quot; was the tunnel thing, which was... it was cool. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:52:25] kass:</b> Maybe it was gimmicky, though, I dunno!</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:53:11] kass:</b> If I were to think about our visual expression class...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:54:31] kass:</b> His main point was that in order to make an expression about what you're seeing, you use contrasting images from shot to shot... and depending on how much contrast there is, it'll result in faster or more frantic mood.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:54:32] aqhong:</b> Haha, see, &quot;gimmicky&quot; is what I thought of when you were describing the difference... reminds me of waaaay back when I went to theme parks with 3D films, and they'd ALWAYS do that thing with a snake jumping out at you or something. Just for the sake of it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:55:07] aqhong:</b> So yeah, I appreciate that Pixar is avoiding that kinda thing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:55:55] kass:</b> Maybe that's all it is then. I dunno. I feel like it's a little weird not to remember ANYTHING in 3d from the film. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:56:15] aqhong:</b> Haha. I dunno, I was aware of the 3D all the way through.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:56:23] aqhong:</b> Then again, I haven't seen as much 3D as you...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:56:30] kass:</b> I've only seen three.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:56:42] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:56:46] kass:</b> HP wasn't all in 3D either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:57:19] kass:</b> But I mean... seeing HP was what really convinced me that 3d wasn't all just talk.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:57:41] kass:</b> Probably helped that I saw it in both 2d and 3d.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:59:02] aqhong:</b> Speaking of contrasting images... the scene where Ellie finds out she can't have kids is a great example of that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[16:59:14] aqhong:</b> It's literally two frames, and maybe five seconds, but it hits you like a ton of bricks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:00:02] kass:</b> Right, but did they use 3D to enhance that? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:00:04] kass:</b> Or was it all just traditional cinematic technique? ::shruuug::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:00:50] aqhong:</b> Oh, I wasn't talking about 3D.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:01:08] kass:</b> I know you weren't. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C43BA8">[17:01:23] Forward Biased:</b> we really have 4+ pages of logs today. Wow...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:04:32] aqhong:</b> I think I essentially agree with you, though... the 3D was subtle to the point where I don't think it added too much to the film. It didn't seem much better in 3D than in 2D, and I'd be perfectly happy to see it again in 2D.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:05:02] kass:</b> Oh, yeah, you did see it in 2d, didn't you. D:</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:05:08] aqhong:</b> Whereas if they took out the soundtrack or something, I think that would be really noticeable...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:05:31] kass:</b> Like... for the HP5 final fight...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:05:37] kass:</b> The difference between 2d and 3d was like night and day.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:05:48] aqhong:</b> Wait, did I see that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:05] kass:</b> You probably saw it in 2d.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:09] kass:</b> I think we all saw it in 2d.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:14] aqhong:</b> Oh, okay.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:15] kass:</b> And then later I went and saw the entire movie again in 3d, just for the ending.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:34] kass:</b> But... in 2d, the last fight felt flat, literally... not just being punny.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:06:52] kass:</b> And 3d, it felt way way more EPIC. And not just gimmicky.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:08:05] kass:</b> But I guess that's its own can of worms... action vs not.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:08:26] aqhong:</b> Yeah, it sounds like there should be a happy medium where the 3D actually adds value without crossing the line into being gimmicky... maybe Coraline and HP were like that. Didn't see either, unfortunately...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#3B72C4">[17:10:58] kass:</b> Anyway. I think there'll be a few years where cinematographers are figuring it out... it'll take some time to develop the language for what elements can be used effectively and what can't.</li>
