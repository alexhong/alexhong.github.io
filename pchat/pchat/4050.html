	<li><b>[23:44:08] aqhong:</b> Of course they could. You can do that with anything :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:44:16] Kass:</b> You said them there as a person who is excited to find their own path and to not let misery stand in their way of getting what they want.</li>
	<li><b>[23:44:30] aqhong:</b> ...what? o_O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:44:37] Kass:</b> ::lol:: What did you mean by the quote?</li>
	<li><b>[23:44:54] aqhong:</b> Man, what did <i>you</i> just mean.</li>
	<li><b>[23:45:00] aqhong:</b> My brain hurts just trying to decipher your last sentence :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:45:10] Kass:</b> Okay, let's strike what I said from the record and start over. What did YOU mean when you said that quote? :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:45:52] aqhong:</b> It means, don't be complacent! Don't even think it's &quot;good enough&quot;! Keep looking for something better :O</li>
	<li><b>[23:45:55] aqhong:</b> ever*</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:46:09] Kass:</b> Doesn't that mean you'll never be satisfied?</li>
	<li><b>[23:46:20] aqhong:</b> Maybe... maybe not :O</li>
	<li><b>[23:46:43] aqhong:</b> Maybe you find satisfaction in the process itself? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:46:44] Kass:</b> You really want to live like that? Feeling like you're never going to be happy until you get x?</li>
	<li><b>[23:46:57] aqhong:</b> No... you misunderstood...</li>
	<li><b>[23:47:05] aqhong:</b> The point is, there <i>is</i> no &quot;x.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:47:44] Kass:</b> ... so... you're never going to be happy? period. :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:47:47] aqhong:</b> There's just one long continuum to infinity, and you should keep on truckin' :O</li>
	<li><b>[23:47:53] aqhong:</b> What if that makes you happy?</li>
	<li><b>[23:47:57] aqhong:</b> The process of improvement?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:48:15] Kass:</b> I'm not sure you can apply that to a job state.</li>
	<li><b>[23:48:31] aqhong:</b> Ummm. I wasn't talking about jobs specifically, but okay...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:48:45] Kass:</b> I'm talking about jobs. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b>[23:48:46] aqhong:</b> I just meant as a life philosophy.</li>
	<li><b>[23:48:48] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:48:55] Kass:</b> Obviously there's no limit on what improvement you can do to yourself.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:49:12] Kass:</b> For yourself, rather.</li>
	<li><b>[23:49:16] aqhong:</b> Well, my point is, maybe satisfaction for some people is less about the accomplishments, and more about what it took to get there. That's all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:49:28] Kass:</b> Sure. I'll buy that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:49:39] Kass:</b> Doesn't apply to jobs and happiness, though. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:49:46] Kass:</b> imho.</li>
	<li><b>[23:49:50] aqhong:</b> Why wouldn't it?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:50:12] Kass:</b> Because there are such things as basic survival that come into play. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:50:24] Kass:</b> And happiness threshholds, or whatever you want to term it.</li>
	<li><b>[23:50:45] aqhong:</b> I'm... not sure I catch your drift.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:50:56] Kass:</b> If you were in a job that really made you happy 80% of the time, would you really quit to go looking for a job that gave you 85%?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:51:08] Kass:</b> What if such a job doesn't exist?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:52:24] Kass:</b> And actually, I imagine such a job couldn't exist, just because you'd always be about the improvement of things and eventually everything you were currently doing would sour if no improvement came along... or something.</li>
	<li><b>[23:52:36] aqhong:</b> Um... I think you're still slightly missing the point... you're still talking about how happy a particular job makes you... what I'm saying is that there isn't some sort of &quot;100% happiness&quot; job, and that the happiness comes from the work that you do.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:52:54] Kass:</b> Okay.</li>
	<li><b>[23:52:59] aqhong:</b> And from the improvement in the work that you do :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:53:29] Kass:</b> If you were in a job that let you do work that made you happy 80% of the time, would you really quit and go looking for something that gave you work that would make you happy 85%? :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:54:10] aqhong:</b> ...okay, maybe I'm not getting this across very clearly :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:54:14] Kass:</b> Apparently this is a concept a lot of people have trouble with... this &quot;100% happiness&quot; thing that I keep employing. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:54:20] Kass:</b> You're supposed to think of it this way.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:54:32] Kass:</b> 100% of your time = every second/moment that you spend working.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:54:45] Kass:</b> Now if at every second you asked yourself, &quot;am I happy?&quot; ... you answer yes. Or you answer no.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:55:04] Kass:</b> People think happiness can't be quantified.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:55:12] Kass:</b> I say, if you do it this way, it most certainly can. :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:55:24] aqhong:</b> I say, even if it can, it's kinda pointless :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:56:02] Kass:</b> My guess is that you merely think that way because you've never been in a situation where you've had to ask yourself that question, &quot;am I happy enough?&quot;</li>
	<li><b>[23:56:21] aqhong:</b> Whoa, when did this become about me? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:56:29] Kass:</b> It's not. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:56:39] Kass:</b> I just said you think it's a pointless question, because you've obviously never had to ask yourself it. :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:56:40] aqhong:</b> Nothing I've said so far is a reflection of how I feel.</li>
	<li><b>[23:56:44] aqhong:</b> Oh.</li>
	<li><b>[23:56:48] aqhong:</b> No, not really.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:56:54] Kass:</b> Yeah. See? :P</li>
	<li><b>[23:56:59] aqhong:</b> See what? :O</li>
	<li><b>[23:57:08] aqhong:</b> Ohh.</li>
	<li><b>[23:57:09] aqhong:</b> No, I mean.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:57:13] Kass:</b> O_o;</li>
	<li><b>[23:57:15] aqhong:</b> No, not really to your last statement.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:57:22] Kass:</b> Yeah, I know.</li>
	<li><b>[23:57:27] aqhong:</b> I've probably asked myself that, subconsciously.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:57:33] Kass:</b> Yeah, that doesn't count.</li>
	<li><b>[23:57:37] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:58:16] Kass:</b> Unless you make all your important life decisions subconsciously too. In which case this whole discussion is completely moot, because whatever it is, you've completely internalized your reactions to your situations and talking about it is silly cause you don't really know what you're talking about. :x</li>
	<li><b>[23:58:31] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b>[23:58:38] aqhong:</b> I totally don't get what you just said, but okay.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:58:59] Kass:</b> I do, but the way it came out makes it really not worth picking apart or rephrasing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:04] Kass:</b> Basically it all amounts to...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:07] Kass:</b> I need more tylenol.</li>
	<li><b>[23:59:09] aqhong:</b> I think it's pointless to make happiness some sort of set &quot;level&quot; and think in a way that you can somehow reach &quot;100% happiness.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:25] Kass:</b> Okay. THAT might be true.</li>
	<li><b>[23:59:37] aqhong:</b> I think it's hard for people to even accurately judge how happy they are themselves.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:51] Kass:</b> That's only if you ask it in a long term scale.</li>
	<li><b>[23:59:52] aqhong:</b> In absolute terms, I mean.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:54] Kass:</b> Which I'm not.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[23:59:59] Kass:</b> I could ask you, right now, do you feel happy?</li>
