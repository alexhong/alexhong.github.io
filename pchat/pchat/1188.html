	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:48:27] Kass:</b> But I suppose you'd rather avoid giving an answer to that rather tacky question, so. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:48:37] Forward Biased:</b> most of the time it's ok, because most of the time only the core members are in the chat</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:48:53] Kass:</b> What do you mean by that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:49:35] Forward Biased:</b> the core members get along and respect each other. It's the ones outside of the core that bear the brunt.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:49:51] Kass:</b> ... Am I a core member?</li>
	<li><b>[00:49:53] aqhong:</b> Here's how I see it: There's a huge range of people in here, in terms of personality, age, temperament, etc, etc, etc. The chat is not going to always be the perfect atmosphere for me. When it becomes too uncomfortable, or just plain uninteresting, I'll ignore it for a while, and just do something else.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:49:57] Kass:</b> Because I don't always get along and/or respect Alex. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:49:59] Forward Biased:</b> and well, the ones that aren't old like me... i.e. the ones that don't automatically get respect</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:50:49] Kass:</b> Quad says something that interests me.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:51:00] Forward Biased:</b> that there's a pecking order here? ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:01] Kass:</b> &quot;the ones that don't automatically get respect&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:51:05] Forward Biased:</b> like all social structures?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:51:22] Forward Biased:</b> and the pecking order is preserved by those at the top?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:35] Kass:</b> I see. Who's at the top?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:44] Kass:</b> And what are the people at the top responsible for?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:52:12] Forward Biased:</b> keeping the people that aren't on top not near the top?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:52:41] Forward Biased:</b> and yes, I'm guilty too.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:53:31] Kass:</b> So, we are responsible, then, for all chat members' ... um. Enjoyment. Rather than sloughing the responsibility off to chatroom participants to know where their limit is?</li>
	<li><b>[00:54:08] aqhong:</b> I don't like the idea that I'm responsible for everyone else in here's &quot;enjoyment.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:54:17] Forward Biased:</b> you will have to make it order for their to be change</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:54:24] Kass:</b> I'm just asking what Quad thinks.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:54:55] Kass:</b> Make... what order? Make it orderly? Make the chat orderly?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:55:08] Kass:</b> Or make it an order.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:55:09] Max:</b> I don't think you can make the chat orderly per se...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:55:13] Forward Biased:</b> make it an order</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:55:24] Kass:</b> And what kind of order is this? O.o</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:55:39] Forward Biased:</b> because as you can see, there is resistance. If you don't bash heads, nothing will change.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:55:52] Kass:</b> Ah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:56:09] Kass:</b> Well that hardly seems fair either, does it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:56:40] Kass:</b> Restricting core members' activities in order to prevent non-core members', as you put it, toes from being stepped on.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#C54006">[00:57:39] Forward Biased:</b> as far as I'm concerned, that's a dilemma for another day as it is past my bed time ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:58:16] Kass:</b> Mmph. I appreciate your input.</li>
	<li class="presence">[00:58:31] Forward Biased left.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:59:08] Kass:</b> Well. I don't really look forward to the idea of militarizing the chatroom.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:59:47] Kass:</b> I agree that it's a bit of an unfair burden, that you be responsible for other people's enjoyment.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:00:06] Kass:</b> After everything we've discussed, is there nothing you would do differently about tonight?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:00:24] Kass:</b> (this is what I'll always come back to, anyway. what would you do different, now that we've talked about this.)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:00:29] Kass:</b> If anything.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:00:42] Max:</b> I don't know. I don't think Tansen was taking the right approach anyway. Change has to be gradual.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:01:01] Kass:</b> What do you think Tansen was trying to accomplish?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:01:03] Max:</b> In such a way, we would not have just stopped</li>
	<li><b>[01:01:20] aqhong:</b> See, that's the thing. I have no idea what he was trying to accomplish.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:01:54] Kass:</b> Use your imagination. Guess.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:02:32] Kass:</b> &quot;MadnessX: See that would be funny if it was sometime during the afternoon when I've had to deal with school for 8 hours.&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:02:39] Kass:</b> What was he trying to say, there?</li>
	<li><b>[01:02:51] aqhong:</b> He was having a bad day? He was reading malicious intent into the things we said to them, even though they're the same things we say to everyone in here, every day?</li>
	<li><b>[01:02:58] aqhong:</b> said to him*</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:03:08] Kass:</b> No, no. That's not what he was trying to ACCOMPLISH.</li>
	<li><b>[01:03:23] aqhong:</b> Umm. Okay...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:03:25] Kass:</b> That might be what the actual scenario was all about, but your response doesn't refer to what he was trying to change.</li>
	<li><b>[01:04:04] aqhong:</b> Actually... I don't understand that quote at all. honestly o_O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:04:57] Kass:</b> Oh well.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:05:12] Max:</b> Care to explain?</li>
	<li><b>[01:05:19] aqhong:</b> It... <i>would</i> be funny if it were during the afternoon after he had to deal with school.</li>
	<li><b>[01:05:24] aqhong:</b> But it's not funny now.</li>
	<li><b>[01:05:32] aqhong:</b> Am I reading that right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:05:40] Kass:</b> That's the general impression I get.</li>
	<li><b>[01:06:02] aqhong:</b> So... it's funny right when he's all stressed out, but not now? o_O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:06:05] Kass:</b> He's probably missing a negative in there somewhere.</li>
	<li><b>[01:06:13] aqhong:</b> Oh.</li>
	<li><b>[01:06:22] aqhong:</b> Well, that would explain a lot.</li>
	<li><b>[01:06:39] aqhong:</b> I guess I'll just assume that's the case...</li>
	<li><b>[01:07:06] aqhong:</b> Wait... that still doesn't make sense &gt;_&lt;</li>
	<li><b>[01:07:08] aqhong:</b> Negative where?</li>
	<li><b>[01:07:24] aqhong:</b> Or maybe you can just pick another quote? -_-</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:07:35] Max:</b> Wherever I insert the negative, the situation comes up to being &quot;Any day I have school&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:07:41] Kass:</b> MadnessX: Why is it that putting down people is first on your list?</li>
	<li><b>[01:08:10] aqhong:</b> Okay. So... what's the question again, exactly?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:08:28] Kass:</b> What you think Tansen was trying to accomplish, by asking that.</li>
	<li><b>[01:10:51] aqhong:</b> My best guess: He wanted to know why we were picking on him?</li>
	<li><b>[01:10:59] aqhong:</b> Or what he perceived as us picking on him?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:11:55] Kass:</b> That's a pretty decent guess. I would actually say that his question was partially rhetorical. My impression is that he literally just wanted to inform you that he was feeling picked on.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:12:10] Kass:</b> He doesn't actually care about your motive for doing so.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:12:15] Kass:</b> Or not doing so, as the case may be.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:13:11] Kass:</b> It's somewhat oblique language, but that's something people do... when they don't want people to think they're whining, when they have a complaint.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:13:26] Kass:</b> Am I reaching or does all this sound sane?</li>
	<li><b>[01:13:40] aqhong:</b> No, it makes sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:15:06] Kass:</b> Okay. So assuming you get that meaning out of it, you have two choices from there. Tell him to suck it up or stop.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:15:17] Kass:</b> And now, I see where you're going to say, but I am not picking on him.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:15:24] Kass:</b> I'm just saying whatever I say to people normally.</li>
	<li><b>[01:15:24] aqhong:</b> Okay, well, I see what I did wrong... I treated him the same way I do treat everyone else, but I didn't take into account that he'd probably had a bad day, and that maybe I should reconsider the way I treated him accordingly.</li>
	<li><b>[01:15:34] aqhong:</b> And my failure to do so is pretty much a textbook definition of insensitivity.</li>
	<li><b>[01:16:03] aqhong:</b> Sound about right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:10] Kass:</b> &gt;_&gt; Sure.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:19] Kass:</b> Wasn't just you, of course.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:16:24] Max:</b> Of course</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:32] Kass:</b> But yeah, that's pretty much how I'd sum it up. O.o</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:16:49] Kass:</b> I did tell Tansen that he should be more obvious about it in the future, should there be one.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:17:04] Kass:</b> I told him that you guys don't cross me, because I make it pretty damn obvious these days when I'm upset with you.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:17:55] Kass:</b> It is, in the end, partially his fault for ... well... not making himself clear.</li>
	<li><b>[01:18:13] aqhong:</b> He could've said &quot;I'm having a bad day.&quot; That would have helped.</li>
	<li><b>[01:18:21] aqhong:</b> No sarcasm intended.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:18:52] Kass:</b> Saw none. And sure, that's true. That might've been the best thing of all, in fact, but it's likely that he didn't believe you guys would sympathize.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:19:38] Kass:</b> I mean, seriously... I don't see myself coming in and being like &quot;i had a bad day /cry&quot; ... and seeing you guys say &quot;awwww, what happened? ::HUG::&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:19:48] Kass:</b> Maybe if were Allison.</li>
	<li><b>[01:19:53] aqhong:</b> Well, not to that extent...</li>
	<li><b>[01:20:08] aqhong:</b> But if he had said that, instead of continuing with those &quot;rhetorical&quot; questions, I probably would've just ignored him. Speaking for myself.</li>
