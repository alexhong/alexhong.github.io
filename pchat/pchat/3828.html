	<li><b>[19:01:00] aqhong:</b> I dunno, is it? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:01:13] Kass:</b> Clarify for me, what the &quot;problem&quot; is that we just experienced.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[19:02:21] Max:</b> The problem is that feedback isn't immediate?</li>
	<li><b>[19:02:24] aqhong:</b> It takes too much effort to contribute and keep things going, and we're all lazy and like instant gratification?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:02:43] Kass:</b> But what's the reverse of that?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:02:51] Kass:</b> No offense to Brandon, but what about his response was even worth reading?</li>
	<li><b>[19:03:11] aqhong:</b> Yeah, that's true...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:03:19] Kass:</b> It wasn't a thought out response to the question being posed. It didn't contribute to the discussion at all.</li>
	<li><b>[19:03:40] aqhong:</b> But I know that that's true for me as well. You don't know how much I had to push myself just to post that ;)</li>
	<li class="status">[19:03:45] Eugene returned.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#338099">[19:03:49] Eugene:</b> so what's punkcraft</li>
	<li><b>[19:03:49] aqhong:</b> I considered just rambling about it in here instead.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:04:11] Kass:</b> I'm sure that's true. But the result of your effort produced a much more impressive result than anything you could spit out here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:05:51] Kass:</b> And Punkcraft isn't really like Metaverse for fogeys, since we set it up without any kind of outside interference. It was our choice to make it.</li>
	<li><b>[19:05:59] aqhong:</b> I guess that relegates Metaverse to &quot;whenever I can build up a crapload of motivation&quot;? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:06:15] Kass:</b> Possibly.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:06:31] Kass:</b> A lot of what you said about Metaverse, I personally think is exactly right.</li>
	<li><b>[19:06:45] aqhong:</b> Quality over quantity to the point where quantity approaches zero ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:06:53] Kass:</b> Metaverse is dead because the majority of the so-called active participants are here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:07:02] Kass:</b> And it takes less effort to speak here than it does on Metaverse.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:07:10] Kass:</b> Again, not an entirely positive trait.</li>
	<li><b>[19:08:08] aqhong:</b> Well, at this point, I don't think you could wean people off of PChat ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:08:36] Kass:</b> That's not really an intention of mine.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:08:51] Kass:</b> My primary concern is Punkcraft's inactivity, not Metaverse's.</li>
	<li><b>[19:09:03] aqhong:</b> Ah. Well, I wouldn't know much about that...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:09:22] Kass:</b> Like you, I have very little interest in Metaverse's survivability. It has never really accomplished anything that I thought to be particularly valuable. :P</li>
	<li><b>[19:09:41] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b>[19:10:12] aqhong:</b> Why did you guys start it again, if it wasn't by choice?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:10:18] Kass:</b> It was Lloyd's idea.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:10:28] Kass:</b> It WAS supposed to be a baby Punkcraft... at the time, Punkworld.</li>
	<li><b>[19:10:35] aqhong:</b> Haha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:10:37] Kass:</b> But geared towards students in TVA.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#5B9D2F">[19:11:30] foxyfigureskater:</b> hi Aida</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:13:21] Kass:</b> At any rate... Punkcraft's been suffering because, I think, there's no new blood.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:13:30] Kass:</b> I'm also a little tired of being the only one who tries to prompt.</li>
	<li class="status">[19:13:51] Eugene went away: 7:13 PM</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:14:16] Kass:</b> I'm fairly sure the participants there are all still checking it for new material... but there's not much of an influx of new material.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:14:27] Kass:</b> Therefore... the only easy solution is new blood.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:14:49] Kass:</b> While I've tried to solve that problem on a person by person basis... adding when I can... well, it's not really enough.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:14:58] Kass:</b> Since Metaverse is also suffering, this just made the most sense.</li>
	<li><b>[19:15:29] aqhong:</b> Okay, well... another thing I'm curious about is: why do you think Metaverse never took off the way Punkcraft did?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:16:10] Kass:</b> Lot of factors... age, geographical factors, etc.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:16:21] Kass:</b> The fact that Pokechat exists is a severe limiting factor as well.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:16:24] Kass:</b> To the grouplog's growth.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:16:41] Kass:</b> Punkland/world's original pool was much more diverse, in some ways.</li>
	<li><b>[19:16:44] aqhong:</b> How active was it before PChat's existence?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:16:56] Kass:</b> I thought it was more active.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[19:16:57] Max:</b> Up and down</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:17:03] Kass:</b> People at least flipped every day.</li>
	<li><b>[19:17:55] aqhong:</b> Well, in any case, I think the reason behind Metaverse's unpopularity or whatever is going to make a big difference in whether or not merging it with Punkcraft will help any...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:18:21] Kass:</b> I'm not sure. Some of it has to do with the fact that Punkcraft people don't come here.</li>
	<li><b>[19:18:35] aqhong:</b> I mean, whether it'll help Punkcraft.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:18:52] Kass:</b> Maybe. The only way Punkcraft will be helped is if Metaverse people obviously post to the log.</li>
	<li><b>[19:18:58] aqhong:</b> I mean, if age and the things you mentioned are the reason Metaverse doesn't do well, how does anything change by folding them into Punkcraft?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:19:21] Kass:</b> I'm hoping the older kids will balance out the younger.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:19:42] Kass:</b> And the fact that in order to talk to the older kids, they have to post to Punkcraft or whatever we call it... since those people don't come here.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:19:58] Kass:</b> In order to respond to people who don't use Pokechat, they have no choice but to post.</li>
	<li><b>[19:20:14] aqhong:</b> What would motivate kiddies to want to talk to the older kids? ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:20:24] Kass:</b> Yeah, well, that is as ever my job.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:20:33] Kass:</b> To find prompts that will interest both generations. :P</li>
	<li><b>[19:22:36] aqhong:</b> Good luck with that, I guess :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:23:18] Kass:</b> At any rate, I don't think your evaluation of e-mail is entirely fair.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:23:55] Kass:</b> All of these technologies we have... IM, e-mail, voicemail, GPS, weblogging, grouplogging, forums, chatrooms... etc. The usefulness of all these items depend on a person's individual lifestyle.</li>
	<li><b>[19:23:59] aqhong:</b> I tried to emphasize that my evaluation only applied to me, and not everyone else ;)</li>
	<li><b>[19:24:03] aqhong:</b> Yeah, exactly.</li>
	<li><b>[19:24:28] aqhong:</b> Maybe I should've italicized more &quot;I&quot;s :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:24:45] Kass:</b> But it's not just for you, it's for other people. If you had a friend who wasn't online very often, or at least not at the same hours you were, but you wanted to talk to them... would you refuse to use e-mail?</li>
	<li><b>[19:25:12] aqhong:</b> No... but I don't know anyone like that.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:25:40] Kass:</b> I didn't know anyone like that either. But I exchanged e-mails for a whole summer with Damien once, because that's all he was up for doing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:25:49] Kass:</b> They were probably the most engaging e-mails I've ever written. &gt;_&gt;;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:26:30] Kass:</b> I don't really enjoy e-mail communication either, but there it is... and it's the only way to get things done sometimes, especially for people who are on the go a lot.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:28:12] Kass:</b> At any rate... I don't read Pokechat logs anymore, since it's too much work to log in to read them.</li>
	<li><b>[19:28:34] aqhong:</b> Anymore? I wasn't aware you ever read them regularly :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:28:42] Kass:</b> It's been on and off.</li>
	<li><b>[19:28:43] aqhong:</b> I thought you said you only check if you think you missed something interesting.</li>
	<li><b>[19:28:48] aqhong:</b> Ah...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:28:51] Kass:</b> I DEFINITELY don't read them anymore, since starting to use IoCC.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:29:02] Kass:</b> For the most part, it really is way too much to read.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:29:12] Kass:</b> And there is very seldom something interesting to go back and review.</li>
	<li><b>[19:29:12] aqhong:</b> Haha, l2skim? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:29:19] Kass:</b> Uh, I skim fine, thanks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:29:31] Kass:</b> I just read the entire Golden Compass in like, two hours.</li>
	<li><b>[19:29:36] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:29:37] Kass:</b> There's nothing wrong with my reading speed. ;P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[19:29:37] Max:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[19:30:00] Kass:</b> At any rate, as I said... mostly the problem is that there's nothing worth reading about.</li>
