	<li class="status">[15:09:58] Xan went away: I hate essays.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:12:04] Kass:</b> Anyway. I don't think it makes much sense to argue about what people's expectations of Travian were.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:12:36] Kass:</b> None of us could have anticipated how slow and ponderous combat actually is. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:12:44] lloyd:</b> Why not? Some people's expectations are bound to have been different. Mine, for instance, as an inexperienced gamer.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:13:01] lloyd:</b> @Max: that's very interesting. If that's a general assumption for experienced gamers, or for Settlers players, that's perfectly fine. I certainly didn't have that assumption, though, nor even the faintest glimmer that that was possible (alliance failing)... though in hindsight, it's obvious. Except that here, the fact that we all went into it as friends/p.chatters, made it quite unlikely for me to imagine such a failure. If it were an alliance of random members (perhaps like most other Travian alliances), then the possibility of alliance failure would have been much more evident to me.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:13:12] Kass:</b> Right, well, I don't think any of the &quot;experienced&quot; players could have guessed at what it would be like either.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:13:15] Kass:</b> I certainly didn't.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:13:45] Kass:</b> And it hardly has anything to do with alliance failure.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:13:51] Kass:</b> It's not that we're not getting along.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:13:55] Kass:</b> People are just losing interest.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:14:05] lloyd:</b> Indeed.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:14:29] Kass:</b> In my opinion, not that it counts since I'm out of the game formally, I think a civil war would be far more interesting than going out against people you don't know.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:14:31] lloyd:</b> Doesn't that count as an alliance failing, though? With &quot;key&quot; members losing interest and just quitting?</li>
	<li><b>[15:14:35] aqhong:</b> Aww, man, (mt </li>
	<li><b>[15:14:42] aqhong:</b> (mt) doing maintenance right now?</li>
	<li><b>[15:14:45] aqhong:</b> I thought you said Friday, Quad :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:15:31] Kass:</b> Maybe in a gaming sense, it is. But then you should have walked into it EXPECTING that it would happen, because all gamers will lose interest eventually.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:16:11] lloyd:</b> Ah, silly me. I had no expectation of such a thing. ::chortle::</li>
	<li class="status">[15:16:29] Terrance went away: 3:16 PM</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:17:10] lloyd:</b> But more specifically, I had no expectation of Quad quitting at this point... not after he had been talking about the endgame, which he said was months away.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:18:15] Kass:</b> And of course my quitting means nothing. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:18:33] lloyd:</b> I didn't imply that at all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:19:01] lloyd:</b> Maybe I should have articulated it when you did quit, but it would have been pointless, I think. But I did find it disappointing.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[15:20:03] Max:</b> If Quad had quit first and Kass hadn't, would you have considered the alliance as falling apart at that point?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:21:11] Kass:</b> Meh, who cares. I quit cause it was boring.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:21:23] Kass:</b> Though maybe I would've stuck around for civil war.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:21:27] lloyd:</b> Yes? And insert [key players] in place of Quad.</li>
	<li class="presence">[15:22:01] Terrance left.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:22:44] Kass:</b> Anyway. I just find it silly to have a game where &quot;end game&quot; can be months away, but you're already in a repetitive loop of routine stuff. ::lol::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:23:00] Kass:</b> At least WoW has different places you can visit/level and quests to undergo and instances to see. -_-</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:24:08] Kass:</b> In such games as these, gamers have to set their own goals to keep things interesting.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:24:25] Kass:</b> Since the game doesn't appear to be providing any.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:25:41] lloyd:</b> Right. My own personal goal for the month is to reach rank 404. ;-) Which has been a lot more slow going, lately. A lot of actives where I am atm, at exactly 420.</li>
	<li><b>[15:26:03] aqhong:</b> My personal goal is to hit 5000 kills :O</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:27:01] Kass:</b> ... dunno why you don't at least challenge yourselves. Aren't those things going to happen anyway, eventually, as long as you keep on the path you're going?</li>
	<li><b>[15:27:11] aqhong:</b> Haha, yeah...</li>
	<li><b>[15:27:15] aqhong:</b> Okay, what would you suggest? :O</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:27:38] Kass:</b> I don't know. I think Travian doesn't lend itself to personal goals very well. O.o Hence why you have these weirdos who go around making NAPs with everyone they can reach.</li>
	<li><b>[15:27:45] aqhong:</b> Hahaha.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[15:28:33] lloyd:</b> Max: you can have your civil war, as long as I'm not involved in it. ;p</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:28:41] Kass:</b> But sure, civil war is easy and has tangible results quick and would be a good way to finish the game, if people were interested in ending it.</li>
	<li><b>[15:28:44] aqhong:</b> It's not civil without Lloyd :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[15:29:03] Max:</b> Pft Lloyd, it's more interesting if you're involved. Much more challenging :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:29:09] Kass:</b> Reason I would say civil war rather than finding some random other alliance... you'll be depressed if you lose, which is unfortunate for an ending.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:29:17] Kass:</b> Or if you win, you're still stuck playing.</li>
	<li><b>[15:29:22] aqhong:</b> :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:29:40] Kass:</b> As opposed to civil war, which means everyone deletes after one side admits defeat.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[15:29:47] Kass:</b> And at least half the people are happy. XP</li>
