	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:03:47] Kass:</b> But they should be plentiful enough so that it's not a big deal.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:04:02] Kass:</b> And then I can go back to allowing people to use excess stat points to make monsters. &gt;_&gt;</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:04:28] Kass:</b> /kek</li>

	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:05:48] Max:</b> We went almost as fast as we could!</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:05:55] Kass:</b> I know, one week wasn't enough to do it all.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#6B824A">[18:05:56] AIDA:</b> Greetings, Ryn3O.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:05:57] Kass:</b> I wasn't really sure.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:06:08] Kass:</b> What the workload of an e-mail prototype would be like.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:06:12] Kass:</b> And how accurate it would be.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:06:26] Kass:</b> And I had NO idea how to allow you guys to do the monster part without it being &quot;live&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:06:48] Kass:</b> The intended design... before a monster attack, you can buy monster traps from the blacksmith.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:06:48] RYN3O:</b> Actual conversation on P Chat when I log on?! :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:09] Kass:</b> And lay them out.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:20] Kass:</b> Not only will they take a monster down, you get to keep it. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:38] Kass:</b> And through some completely automated taming process, it becomes a part of the city defenses.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:07:40] Max:</b> Er... what would we do with it? Treat it like an adventurer?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:07:42] Max:</b> Oh</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:07:46] Kass:</b> And you can use stat points on it to make it stronger.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:08:14] Kass:</b> You're totally right, by the way, about the siege aspect of monster attacks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:08:25] Kass:</b> I want it to be way more like TD and way less like a really bizzare war.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:08:34] Kass:</b> But I didn't have time to figure it out.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:08:43] Kass:</b> Like I said, I was making shit up. D:</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:09:16] Kass:</b> I don't know that I'll be able to do real traditional TD because there's no distance built into the game at all right now and I'm not sure I want to go there.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:09:27] RYN3O:</b> So many directions you could go with that game, It killed my creativity when I thought about it &gt;.&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:09:56] Kass:</b> What're you talking about. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:09:58] Max:</b> Well, you could do battle lines :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:10:15] Max:</b> With the wall taking up the entire front line</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:10:31] Max:</b> And maybe multiple walls behind it... and we'd retreat behind them</li>
	<li><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:11:16] RYN3O:</b> lol, You're talking about that game that I played as a prototype a month back, right? When you asked for feedback I couldn't really cme up with anything because there were so many diffrent aspects and ideas, and I really didn't have an idea of what would actually work.</li>
	<li class="emote"><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:11:47] RYN3O dissapears into corner and lets kass / max talk.</b></li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:11:48] Kass:</b> I don't think I want battle lines either... it's too traditional. The problem is that I'm not sure how to integrate the adventurers/monsters, which are single units with spells and stuff, with a town offense/defense strength... and monsters that are units.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:11:52] Max:</b> We're talking about the week-long playtest that recently finished</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:12:01] Kass:</b> Oh, you actually remember that, Ryan? ::lol::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:12:13] Kass:</b> It's the same game, only Max was involved in a more recent playtest.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:12:44] RYN3O:</b> Oh. That looks like itd be really time consuming</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:00] Kass:</b> Maybe something a little like My Life as a Darklord, except I didn't like how heroes would only spend x time on a floor.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:08] Kass:</b> That's very un-TD.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:11] Kass:</b> well.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:16] Kass:</b> I guess it's not, actually. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:27] Kass:</b> Here, the point is that there's no central thing to guard for the town.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:37] Kass:</b> Like the monsters aren't mindlessly going for the center like in typical TDs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:13:37] Max:</b> The un-TD part was when heroes skipped levels because other heroes were there &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:13:47] Kass:</b> yeah, that was REALLY lame. :X</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:14:38] Kass:</b> The most realistic thing would be for monsters to attack buildings to a certain point, probably not total destruction and then move onto something else.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:14:43] Max:</b> Monsters would attack other structures, not just Guard towers and walls? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:14:53] Kass:</b> I dunno. What do you think?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:06] Kass:</b> They should definitely go for buildings if there aren't any guard towers / walls left!</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:11] Kass:</b> That makes sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:32] Kass:</b> I suppose in a primitive way, the monsters SHOULD go for things that are attacking them first.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:44] Kass:</b> So that definitely includes guard towers.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:15:52] Kass:</b> Does that include adventurers too?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:16:09] Max:</b> I'd think so</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:16:20] Kass:</b> Or do you really want adventurers to be hiding behind walls all the time?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:16:24] Kass:</b> Until there aren't any left?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:16:28] Kass:</b> That might be kind of interesting.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:16:29] Max:</b> But still, I definitely think that if we have a wall, we'd use it</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:16:36] Kass:</b> But then only ranged adventurers could contribute.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:16:41] Kass:</b> Ranged attackers, that is.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:17:06] Max:</b> Well, you haven't yet really made a distinction between melee and ranged really</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:17:31] Kass:</b> Magic is definitely ranged.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:18:46] Max:</b> Among physical attacks, swords are melee and bows are ranged, but what's stopping an adventurer from using both?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:19:07] Kass:</b> Dunno. Nothing possibly. ::lol::</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:19:20] Kass:</b> No reason to stop them from using both, is there?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:19:40] Max:</b> Then there isn't a problem if they just take up bows so they can still attack from the safety of a wall XD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:20:10] Kass:</b> Maybe they take a tiny penalty for going ranged, just because swinging a sword and releasing an arrow isn't exactly the same motion.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:20:54] Kass:</b> But it'd be kind of neat if we ended up doing the front/back row thing and you could only do melee physical damage from the front row and if you put a melee physical damager in back, they'd do bow attacks.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:02] Kass:</b> For a penalty.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:09] Kass:</b> Then again, that encourages balanced parties.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:15] Kass:</b> Or... demands balanced parties.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:21:25] Kass:</b> ... Or... specifically discourages full physical damage parties.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:22:52] Kass:</b> So then it'd be fun if the final wall fell and THEN the battle disintegrated from a siege type thing to a &quot;normal&quot; battle.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:23:11] Max:</b> And hopefully you eliminated enough enemies to give yourself a fighting chance :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:23:16] Kass:</b> Yeah. &gt;_&gt;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:23:55] Kass:</b> ... I guess resources have to be spent to rebuild buildings, of course.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:24:05] Kass:</b> Manpower as well.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:24:37] Max:</b> Destroyed buildings stay destroyed I assume. What about damaged buildings?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:24:48] Max:</b> Go down in rank a few times like in Travian?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:25:29] Kass:</b> I suppose that's the only thing that makes sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:25:51] Kass:</b> Did they behave like lower rank buildings, too?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:26:16] Kass:</b> Or did they go down in rank, but still produced at the higher rank, and you just had to build back up to that point before you could continue upgrading again?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:26:27] Max:</b> They did behave like lower rank buildings</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:26:33] Kass:</b> Mm.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:26:49] Max:</b> In fact, that's the reason attacking crop was so effective, because you could go to negative crop and have your army starve to death</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:27:13] Kass:</b> Eesh.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:29:29] Kass:</b> Hum. Well. I guess I just have to figure out what stats to have, how many, what they handle.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:29:35] Kass:</b> Rather, decide on.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:30:30] Kass:</b> ::lol:: Should there be mana? :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:30:33] Max:</b> Are you going to continue with the &quot;each battle participant attacks once in turn, rinse, repeat&quot; or have the possibility of someone attacking multiple times for every one of another?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[18:30:41] Max:</b> Is mana going to regenerate like hp? XD</li>
	<li><b style="color:#B8AC14">[18:30:48] RYN3O:</b> lol, what kind of game doesn't have mana!</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:11] Kass:</b> I would like to have buffs like haste or slow.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:16] Kass:</b> ... Buffs/debuffs.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:31:57] Kass:</b> I don't think that will mean adventurers necessarily get double the turns when they're hasted, but they will get to &quot;go more often&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[18:32:33] Kass:</b> I think it will look more like FF10's turn system, if you remember that.</li>
