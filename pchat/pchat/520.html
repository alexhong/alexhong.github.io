	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:38:48] Max:</b> Aww, I lost 13 clubswingers</li>
	<li class="status">[00:39:11] Max went away: Shower</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:41:34] Kass:</b> So, the idea is that... there IS meaning that is being diluted, but it's not the negative one that we actually want to get rid of. O.o It's the original, non-negative that's being lost.</li>
	<li><b>[00:43:34] aqhong:</b> But the loss of the original meaning means we can use the term derogatorily without that connection to the original meaning? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:45:15] Kass:</b> Yeah. That's true.</li>
	<li><b>[00:46:15] aqhong:</b> The question is... why did we pick these terms to use derogatorily in the first place? Just because they sound good? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:46:55] Kass:</b> That's not that difficult a question to answer. :P</li>
	<li><b>[00:47:41] aqhong:</b> What's the answer?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:47:57] Kass:</b> Well... all of these words have an association to people who have some kind of condition that makes them &quot;abnormal&quot;.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:48:24] Kass:</b> Therefore, that makes them the only useful words for insulting/offending others.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:49:20] Kass:</b> Or insulting/offending things.</li>
	<li><b>[00:49:21] aqhong:</b> So we're attaching a negative meaning at the same time the non-negative one gets lost? What's the cause and effect here?</li>
	<li class="presence">[00:49:46] lloyd joined.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:50:16] Kass:</b> I guess the negative meaning actually overpowers the non-negative one, in some sense.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:11] Kass:</b> It's the same thing that's happening now. I mean, what will happen in twenty, thirty years, maybe longer... if people keep using &quot;gay&quot; as a expletive term.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:22] Kass:</b> When you first learned the word &quot;dumb&quot;, what was its association?</li>
	<li><b>[00:51:32] aqhong:</b> Stupid.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:51:51] Kass:</b> Right... same for me. I didn't learn that &quot;dumb&quot; also meant &quot;person who can't speak&quot; until after ... uh, well after reading a book actually, but anyway.</li>
	<li><b>[00:52:00] aqhong:</b> lol.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:06] Kass:</b> So I think the same thing will end up happening for gay, eventually, given enough time.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:12] Kass:</b> And given enough people who don't curb their own usage of it.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:29] Kass:</b> New youth will end up learning the word in a context that it was not originally made for.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:36] Kass:</b> ... Of course... when you think about it...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:42] Kass:</b> &quot;gay&quot; already has an original meaning that is already being lost, right?</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:47] Kass:</b> It's supposed to mean &quot;happy&quot;. -_-</li>
	<li><b>[00:52:53] aqhong:</b> Hmm, yeah...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:52:55] Kass:</b> And now it means homosexuals.</li>
	<li><b>[00:53:03] aqhong:</b> Wow, that complicates things XD</li>
	<li><b>[00:53:16] aqhong:</b> How did it go from happy to homosexual...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:53:32] Kass:</b> Because homosexuals are seen as being overly happy, overly cheerful, &quot;fairy&quot; type people.</li>
	<li><b>[00:53:41] aqhong:</b> The word started to acquire sexual connotations in the late 17th century, being used with meaning &quot;addicted to pleasures and dissipations&quot;. This was by extension from the primary meaning of &quot;carefree&quot;: implying &quot;uninhibited by moral constraints&quot;</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:53:52] Kass:</b> Okay, that's better. XP</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:54:10] Kass:</b> What you really have to wonder is how it went from strictly meaning &quot;happy&quot; to being a negative expletive term. O.o</li>
	<li><b>[00:54:12] aqhong:</b> That's a bit of a stretch, if you ask me, but whatever...</li>
	<li><b>[00:54:16] aqhong:</b> Yeah.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:54:26] Kass:</b> But yeah, human nature at its worst.</li>
	<li class="status">[00:54:45] Max returned.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:55:15] Kass:</b> Or something.</li>
	<li><b>[00:55:29] aqhong:</b> (It's a serious discussion in PChat :O!!!)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:56:53] Kass:</b> Now I wonder which were actually the original meanings of &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot;.</li>
	<li><b>[00:57:03] aqhong:</b> Anyway. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I should bother to stop people from using &quot;gay&quot; that way, if it's really just a continuation of this established pattern...</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:57:37] Kass:</b> ::lol:: That's a much more loaded question, I guess. :P</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:57:45] Kass:</b> There's probably not much one or two people can do about it.</li>
	<li><b>[00:57:54] aqhong:</b> Well, yeah.</li>
	<li><b>[00:59:00] aqhong:</b> (Just hit &quot;Upgrade to level 20&quot; on Marketplace :O)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[00:59:03] Kass:</b> It might be inevitable, really. -_-</li>
	<li><b>[00:59:15] aqhong:</b> Hear that, Mr. Andersen? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:59:42] Max:</b> (How many insults can we compile before some of them regain their meaning from lack of use? :O)</li>
	<li><b>[01:00:12] aqhong:</b> I don't think the process reverses itself ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:00:33] Max:</b> Likely not. In the end, you won't be able to speak without insulting someone ;)</li>
	<li><b>[01:00:49] aqhong:</b> Then again, I guess there's no way of knowing unless... hmmm. What derogatory terms have gone out of fashion in recent decades? :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:01:12] Max:</b> There must've been a few hippie terms that went out of style</li>
	<li><b>[01:01:47] aqhong:</b> Yeah, but are those terms even based on abnormalities? I have a feeling that's one of the few periods where they just picked certain terms because they sounded good ;)</li>
	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:02:30] Kass:</b> Or sounded good when they were stoned.</li>
	<li><b>[01:02:35] aqhong:</b> Precisely :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:02:57] Max:</b> Well, can you find words that gained meanings and lost them? :O</li>
	<li><b>[01:03:10] aqhong:</b> That's what I'm trying to do :O</li>

	<li><b>[01:07:29] aqhong:</b> &quot;BANANA (an acronym of Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything or possibly Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone) is a term most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain interest groups to land development.&quot;</li>

	<li><b style="color:#336699">[01:09:47] Kass:</b> Hey Alex, do you like this description of yourself... &quot;designers have the ability and the training to harness the tacit knowledge of the unconscious mind, rather than being limited to working with explicit knowledge.
