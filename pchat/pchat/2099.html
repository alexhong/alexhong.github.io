	<li><b>[00:31:58] aqhong:</b> Man, the spin is just hysterical. Her campaign basically said that if Obama doesn't win Texas and Ohio by considerable margins, <i>she</i> wins :O</li>
	<li><b>[00:32:06] aqhong:</b> You know, since she's so far ahead as it is :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[00:33:25] Max:</b> She should stop hogging airtime so we can focus on more important issues. Like Comcast throttling internet :O</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:07:10] lloyd:</b> That said, I'm not giving 100% credence to these.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:07:53] lloyd:</b> But still... Hillary has been fighting tooth and nail, and if she gets both the popular vote lead in TX and OH tomorrow, she's definitely going to play on.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:08:19] lloyd:</b> I'm saying she'll win the popular vote in TX by a small margin, but be slightly behind in delegates.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:08:59] lloyd:</b> ...and that's going to be dreadful for the party.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:13] lloyd:</b> Obama should be focusing his sights (and spending his money) on McCain now.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:35] lloyd:</b> I was optimistic about Obama winning TX, until a few days ago.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:09:58] lloyd:</b> It's going to be chaotic there tomorrow... and I'm not sure that's an entirely good thing for Obama.</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:11:11] lloyd:</b> And they're probably going to try the same crap in the TX caucuses.</li>
	<li><b>[01:11:12] aqhong:</b> I only heard about it a few days ago...</li>
	<li><b>[01:11:32] aqhong:</b> Wasn't reported at all in the media :/</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:13:55] lloyd:</b> It's going to be close across the board tomorrow... which should be seen as a win for Obama, obviously. But that's not going to happen. The Clintons are going to spin that mightily as a victory for HRC.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:14:50] lloyd:</b> If there's to be a surprise, I think it'll have to be in OH... which I hope will be a repeat of Wisconsin...</li>

	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:15:20] lloyd:</b> That's their game plan now.</li>

	<li><b>[01:16:37] aqhong:</b> More like no math :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#438851">[01:17:23] lloyd:</b> That doesn't matter any more, really. The question is, will Hillary do the right thing for the party, and withdraw soon after tomorrow, or not.</li>
	<li><b>[01:19:57] aqhong:</b> I wouldn't give her much credit for doing the &quot;right thing.&quot; She's been pretty good at avoiding that :O</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:20:21] Max:</b> Her compass definitely doesn't point north :O</li>
	<li><b>[01:22:16] aqhong:</b> There's no realistic way she can even up the delegate count at this point. Which means her only possibility for the nomination is to steal it. And if she doesn't drop out tomorrow, I will assume that's her plan.</li>
	<li><b style="color:#686564">[01:22:42] Max:</b> Man, if that happens all hell will break loose</li>
